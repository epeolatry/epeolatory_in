A Kashmiri Pandit family has just moved into their new home. The patriarch Papaji is a clerk in a food cooperative and his wife Byenji is a homemaker. The narrator is their eight-year-old grandson who spends his days playing cricket and climbing the tang kul in the garden. Everything is rosy till 1989. But then, propelled by ISI and the Jamaat, a secessionist movement rises and changes everything.</p> <p>Lolab valley, 1968. After years of prayers, a boy named Shahid is born to Zun and her husband. He grows up in a society where corruption and unemployment are rife. The trajectory of his life changes when he meets Syed Sahab — an Islamic theologian and rabble-rouser, who wants to overthrow the Indian state.</p> <p>The stories of both families intertwine tragically. In both cases, the boys are at the mercy of forces much larger than them. Both lose their Kashmir, in different ways.</p> <h3 id="my-review"><strong>My Review:</strong></h3> <p>“This Our Paradise” by Karan Mujoo is a story set in India’s paradise—Kashmir—where the idea of “paradise” means different things to different people. For some, it represents home, stability, and the comfort of a life once known. For others, it is the pursuit of independence: a life free from political tug-of-war and from elements that don’t align with their beliefs.</p> <p>The writing is restrained and descriptive. Rather than provoking nationalism or anger, the author calmly presents the multiple realities of the conflict in Kashmir. Reading it feels like listening to a grandparent recount stories of war—distant in tone, yet deeply personal. These stories don’t demand emotional reactions; instead, they just quietly remind you of loss.</p> <p>The book offers a rare opportunity to understand the lives of Kashmiris without political noise, excessive dramatisation, or unnecessary commercialisation.</p> <p>Highly recommended for readers seeking a quieter, more reflective perspective on conflict-heavy narratives that dominate the world today.</p> <p>Suitable for age: 16+</p> <h3 id="happy-reading"><strong><em>Happy Reading!!</em></strong></h3>
