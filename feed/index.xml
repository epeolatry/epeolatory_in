Cultural sensitivity encompasses the understanding, respect, and accurate portrayal of different cultures, backgrounds, and identities. In this blog, we will explore five key reasons why cultural sensitivity is essential when writing diverse characters and narratives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Authentic Representation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural sensitivity ensures that diverse characters and narratives are authentically represented. It involves conducting thorough research, consulting with individuals from the cultures you are portraying, and avoiding stereotypes or misinterpretations. By approaching diverse characters with cultural sensitivity, writers can bring depth, nuance, and realism to their stories. Authentic representation allows readers from marginalized communities to see themselves reflected positively in literature, fostering a sense of belonging and validation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fostering Understanding and Empathy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing with cultural sensitivity promotes understanding and empathy among readers. By accurately portraying diverse characters and cultures, writers can challenge stereotypes and prejudices, allowing readers to develop a more nuanced understanding of different backgrounds. This understanding fosters empathy, breaks down barriers, and promotes a more inclusive society. When readers can relate to and empathize with diverse characters, it broadens their perspective and encourages them to embrace diversity in real life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Avoiding Harmful Stereotypes and Misrepresentations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural sensitivity is crucial in avoiding harmful stereotypes and misrepresentations that perpetuate biases and misconceptions. Stereotypes can lead to the perpetuation of harmful narratives that marginalize or dehumanize certain cultural groups. By understanding the complexities and nuances of different cultures, writers can steer clear of one-dimensional portrayals that reinforce harmful stereotypes. Instead, they can create multi-dimensional characters and narratives that reflect the diversity and richness of the real world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Building Credibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural sensitivity builds credibility and authenticity in storytelling. Readers appreciate well-researched and thoughtfully crafted narratives that accurately reflect the cultures and experiences being depicted. When writers demonstrate cultural sensitivity, they establish trust with their readers, enhancing the overall quality of their work. A lack of cultural sensitivity can lead to readers questioning the credibility of the story and the intentions of the writer. Authenticity in diverse storytelling resonates with readers and strengthens the impact of the narrative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Opening Doors for Diverse Voices:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural sensitivity creates opportunities for diverse voices to be heard and represented in literature. By prioritizing accurate and respectful portrayals, writers can help break down barriers and open doors for underrepresented communities. Writing with cultural sensitivity encourages publishers, agents, and readers to seek out diverse perspectives, ultimately promoting greater diversity in the literary landscape. By amplifying diverse voices and stories, writers contribute to a more inclusive and equitable society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cultural sensitivity is not just a matter of political correctness; it is an essential aspect of responsible and impactful storytelling. Approaching the creation of diverse characters and narratives with cultural sensitivity, is a powerful way to promote inclusivity, celebrate diversity, and create a more compassionate and interconnected literary world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jun 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/06/04/Importance-of-Cultural-Sensitivity-in-Writing-Diverse-Characters-and-Narratives/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/06/04/Importance-of-Cultural-Sensitivity-in-Writing-Diverse-Characters-and-Narratives/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Handle Rejection as a Writer</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a writer comes with its fair share of challenges, and one of the toughest hurdles to overcome is rejection. Whether it’s a rejection letter from a literary agent, a negative review, or a declined submission, facing rejection can be disheartening and demotivating. However, rejection is an inevitable part of the writing journey, and learning to handle it effectively is crucial for your growth as a writer. In this blog, we will discuss five effective ways to handle rejection as a writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace a Growth Mindset:&lt;/strong&gt; Rejection can be a powerful catalyst for growth if you approach it with the right mindset. Instead of viewing rejection as a personal failure, see it as an opportunity to learn and improve. Understand that even the most successful writers have faced rejection numerous times before finding success. Embrace a growth mindset by focusing on continuous learning, honing your craft, and seeking constructive feedback. By seeing rejection as a stepping stone rather than a setback, you can maintain your motivation and keep moving forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek Feedback from Fellow Writers:&lt;/strong&gt; Writing can be a solitary pursuit, but you don’t have to face rejection alone. Reach out to fellow writers, either through local writing groups, online communities, or social media platforms. Connecting with other writers who have experienced rejection can provide valuable support, encouragement, and advice. Share your experiences, vent your frustrations, and learn from the experiences of others. Remember, you are not alone in your journey, and the writing community is often eager to help fellow writers navigate the challenges of rejection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Small Victories:&lt;/strong&gt; Rejection can sometimes overshadow the progress you’ve made as a writer. To maintain your motivation, it’s important to celebrate the small victories along the way. Did you complete a challenging chapter? Did you receive positive feedback from a beta reader? Did you meet a personal writing goal? Acknowledge and celebrate these accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem. By focusing on your progress and the positive aspects of your writing journey, you can maintain a sense of motivation and momentum, even in the face of rejection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take Breaks and Practice Self-Care:&lt;/strong&gt; Rejection can take an emotional toll, and it’s important to prioritize self-care during challenging times. Writing can be an intense and demanding process, so make sure to take breaks when needed. Engage in activities that rejuvenate and inspire you, whether it’s reading a book, going for a walk in nature, or spending time with loved ones. Taking care of your physical and mental well-being will help you bounce back from rejection and approach your writing with renewed energy and motivation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Writing and Submitting:&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps the most crucial aspect of handling rejection is to keep writing and submitting your work. Rejection should not deter you from pursuing your writing goals. Remember that every successful writer has faced rejection, and perseverance is often the key to success. Revise your work based on the feedback you receive, polish your craft, and continue to submit your work to literary agents, publishers, or journals. The more you write and submit, the higher your chances of finding the right opportunity that resonates with your work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rejection is an inevitable part of the writing journey, but it doesn’t have to be a roadblock. By following these tips, you can effectively handle rejection and maintain your motivation as a writer. Remember that rejection is not a reflection of your worth as a writer, but rather an opportunity for growth and improvement. Stay resilient, keep writing, and believe in your craft. Success may be just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jun 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/06/03/How-to-Handle-Rejection-as-a-Writer/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/06/03/How-to-Handle-Rejection-as-a-Writer/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall the work of Charles Dickens, this magnificent novel captures all the cruelty and corruption, dignity and heroism, of India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers—a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village—will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, &lt;em&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/em&gt; creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;8A Fine Balance* by Rohinton Mistry is a poignant and gripping novel that takes readers on a captivating journey through the chaos and challenges of India in the late 1900s. Set against the backdrop of India in a state of emergency, 28 years after its independence, Mistry’s book delves into the lives of its characters, portraying a society where money is power and the poor struggle to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around Dina Dalal, who anxiously awaits the arrival of two tailors, Ishvar and Omprakash, to help her establish a tailoring business. Alongside Dina, we are introduced to Maneck Kohlah, a young man seeking refuge from the struggles of college life and hostel by staying at Dina’s home. Through Mistry’s expert storytelling, we gradually uncover the complex backstories of these characters, which become a microcosm of the larger societal struggles faced by India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What makes &lt;em&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/em&gt; truly remarkable is its ability to bring national-level issues down to a personal level. Mistry artfully weaves the characters’ lives together, showcasing their unwavering resilience in the face of adversity. The emotional rollercoaster ride is both heart-wrenching and inspiring as the characters grapple with poverty, corruption, and the fragility of their circumstances. The author skillfully captures the essence of hope, faith, and friendship, illustrating how these intangible forces become lifelines in the midst of chaos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the story does not offer a conventional happy ending, it leaves readers with a bittersweet sense of hope. It serves as a poignant reminder that even in the face of overwhelming challenges, there can be moments of resilience and connection that offer solace and meaning. The conclusion, though slightly disappointing, adds to the overall impact of the narrative, leaving a lasting impression and encouraging contemplation about the complexities of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of experiencing &lt;em&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/em&gt; through the Audible Audiobook narrated by Vikas Adams, and it was an absolute delight. Adams’ versatile voice breathed life into the story, effortlessly capturing the essence of each character. His ability to convey distinct voices added depth and engagement to the already superb storytelling. Whether it was Mistry’s distinguished writing style or Adams’ exceptional talent, the audiobook was a truly immersive experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, &lt;em&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/em&gt; is a masterfully crafted novel that offers a profound exploration of human resilience, hope, and friendship. Rohinton Mistry’s storytelling prowess combined with Vikas Adams’ exceptional narration creates an unforgettable experience. This book is a must-read for those seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally charged tale that will stay with them long after the final page.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trigger Warning: &lt;em&gt;A Fine Balance&lt;/em&gt; by Rohinton Mistry includes scenes depicting sensitive and potentially distressing content. These scenes involve instances of rape, molestation, mutilation, and murder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/25/A-Fine-Balance-by-Rohinton-Mistry/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/25/A-Fine-Balance-by-Rohinton-Mistry/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Timeless Books in the Public Domain (2023)</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Books hold the power to transport us to different worlds, broaden our perspectives, and inspire our imagination.

Here are five ways to write sad emotions in fiction:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Show, don’t tell&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of simply stating that a character is sad, show their emotions through their actions, thoughts, and dialogue. For example, you could describe how a character’s voice shakes as they try to hold back tears, or how they avoid eye contact with others. By showing the physical and emotional reactions of a character, you can create a more realistic and relatable portrayal of sadness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use sensory details&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incorporating sensory details can help immerse readers in the emotional experience of a character. For example, you could describe the sound of rain tapping against a window, the smell of a loved one’s favorite perfume, or the taste of tears on a character’s tongue. These details can evoke feelings of sadness and create a more vivid and memorable scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore the source of the sadness&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding the cause of a character’s sadness can make their emotions more impactful and meaningful. Consider the character’s backstory, relationships, and current situation to create a deeper understanding of their emotional state. By exploring the root of a character’s sadness, you can create a more nuanced and layered portrayal of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use contrast&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contrasting moments of happiness or joy with moments of sadness can create a more powerful emotional impact. For example, you could describe a character’s happy memories of a loved one before revealing their passing. By juxtaposing these contrasting emotions, you can create a more poignant and memorable scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use symbolism&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symbolism can help convey emotions in a more subtle and effective way. For example, you could use a rainy day to symbolize a character’s sadness, or use a wilting flower to represent a dying relationship. Symbolism can add depth and meaning to a story, and create a more resonant emotional experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, writing sad emotions in fiction requires careful attention to detail and an understanding of the character’s emotional state. By showing emotions through actions and dialogue, using sensory details, exploring the source of sadness, using contrast, and incorporating symbolism, you can create a moving and powerful portrayal of sadness in your writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/19/How-to-Write-Sad-Emotions-in-Fiction/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/19/How-to-Write-Sad-Emotions-in-Fiction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Genres in Fiction</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Literature is a vast and diverse field, encompassing a wide range of genres that appeal to different readers. Here are some of the major genres in literature and what makes them unique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;romance&quot;&gt;Romance&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romance novels are focused on the development of a romantic relationship between two characters. They often feature themes of love, passion, and heartbreak. Romance novels can range from sweet and lighthearted to steamy and erotic, and are often set in different time periods and locations. For example “Me Before You” by Jojo Moyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;fantasy&quot;&gt;Fantasy&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fantasy novels are set in fictional worlds or alternate realities and often involve magic, mythical creatures, and epic quests. They can be high fantasy, with complex world-building and intricate political systems, or low fantasy, with a more narrow focus on a particular character or plot. Popular examples include the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien and the “Harry Potter” series by J.K. Rowling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;science-fiction&quot;&gt;Science Fiction&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science fiction novels often explore the intersection between technology and society, imagining worlds that are vastly different from our own. They can be dystopian, utopian, or somewhere in between, and often deal with themes of space exploration, time travel, and artificial intelligence. Examples include “The Martian” by Andy Weir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;young-adult&quot;&gt;Young Adult&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young adult (YA) novels are geared towards readers aged 12 to 18 and often deal with themes of coming-of-age, identity, and first love. They can encompass a variety of genres, including romance, fantasy, and dystopian fiction. Popular examples include “The Hunger Games” by Suzanne Collins and “The Fault in Our Stars” by John Green.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;comedy&quot;&gt;Comedy&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comedy novels are written with the intention of making readers laugh. They often feature humorous characters and situations, and can range from witty and satirical to slapstick and silly. Comedy novels can be standalone works or part of a series. Examples include “Bridget Jones’s Diary” by Helen Fielding and “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” by Douglas Adams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;historical-fiction&quot;&gt;Historical Fiction&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Historical fiction novels are set in a specific time period and often incorporate real-life events or figures. They can range from sweeping epics to more intimate stories focused on individual characters. Historical fiction novels can provide insight into different cultures and time periods, and often explore themes of identity, power, and social change. Examples include “The Nightingale” by Kristin Hannah and “The Help” by Kathryn Stockett.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;drama&quot;&gt;Drama&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drama novels are centered around conflicts and emotions, and often explore themes of love, loss, and personal growth. They can be set in various time periods and locations, and can range from tragedies to stories with a more hopeful outlook. Drama novels often feature complex characters and relationships. Examples include “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee and “The Great Gatsby” by F. Scott Fitzgerald.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;mystery&quot;&gt;Mystery&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mystery novels are focused on solving a crime or uncovering a hidden truth. They often feature a detective or amateur sleuth who uses logic and deduction to piece together clues and catch the culprit. Mystery novels can be cozy and lighthearted, or dark and suspenseful. Examples include “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes” by Arthur Conan Doyle and “Gone Girl” by Gillian Flynn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;horror&quot;&gt;Horror&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Horror novels are designed to scare and unsettle readers, often through the use of supernatural or psychological elements. They can range from classic ghost stories to contemporary thrillers, and often deal with themes of fear, death, and the unknown. Examples include “Dracula” by Bram Stoker and “The Shining” by Stephen King.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;thriller&quot;&gt;Thriller&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thriller novels are designed to keep readers on the edge of their seats, often featuring fast-paced action and suspenseful plot twists. They can involve espionage, crime, and conspiracies, and often feature a hero or protagonist who must overcome great obstacles to save the day. Examples include “The Da Vinci Code” by Dan Brown and “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” by Stieg Larsson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;gothic-fiction&quot;&gt;Gothic Fiction&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gothic fiction novels feature dark, mysterious, and supernatural elements, often set in eerie and foreboding environments like haunted mansions or castles. These novels explore themes of horror, death, and the unknown, and often include suspenseful plot twists. Examples include “Frankenstein” by Mary Shelley and “Dracula” by Bram Stoker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;magical-realism&quot;&gt;Magical Realism&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Magical realism novels blend elements of fantasy and reality, often featuring magical or supernatural occurrences within a realistic setting. These novels often explore themes of identity, culture, and spirituality, and challenge readers to question the boundaries between reality and imagination. Examples include “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and “The House of the Spirits” by Isabel Allende.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mixing different genres together while writing fiction can result in a rich and unique story that breaks traditional boundaries and captivates readers. The art of genre-mixing requires a delicate balance of different elements, such as plot, character, setting, and tone, and can be a fun and challenging exercise for writers looking to push their creativity to new heights. So don’t be afraid to experiment with different genres and see where your imagination takes you - you might just discover a whole new world of storytelling possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/16/Genres-in-Fiction/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/16/Genres-in-Fiction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Make Fiction Interesting by Using Cliffhangers in Chapters</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Fiction is a wonderful way to escape reality and lose yourself in a story. But what makes a story truly compelling? One technique that has been used for centuries is the cliffhanger. A cliffhanger is a literary device that leaves the reader in suspense at the end of a chapter, creating a sense of urgency to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five ways to make fiction interesting by using cliffhangers in chapters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Build tension&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to use cliffhangers is to build tension throughout the story. By gradually increasing the stakes and suspense, readers will become more invested in the story and eager to find out what happens next. For instance, a mystery novel might end a chapter with a revelation about the identity of the killer, leaving readers on the edge of their seats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use foreshadowing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreshadowing is a literary technique that hints at what’s to come later in the story. By using subtle hints and clues, readers will be able to anticipate what might happen next, adding to the suspense and intrigue of the story. A great way to use foreshadowing is to end a chapter with a cryptic statement that hints at something big to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Leave a question unanswered&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;By leaving a question unanswered at the end of a chapter, readers will be eager to keep reading to find out what happens next. For example, a romance novel might end a chapter with the protagonist being proposed to by two different suitors, leaving the reader wondering who she will choose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use a plot twist&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;A plot twist is a sudden, unexpected change in the direction of the story. By using a plot twist at the end of a chapter, readers will be left reeling and eager to find out how the story will continue. For instance, a thriller might end a chapter with the protagonist discovering that their trusted ally is actually the villain in disguise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;End with a cliffhanger&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most obvious way to use a cliffhanger is to end a chapter with a literal cliffhanger. By leaving the protagonist in a dangerous or uncertain situation, readers will be compelled to keep reading to find out what happens next. For instance, a fantasy novel might end a chapter with the protagonist dangling off a cliff, leaving readers wondering how they will escape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, cliffhangers are a powerful tool for making fiction interesting and keeping readers engaged. However, it’s important to use cliffhangers judiciously, as too many can become predictable and lose their impact. By carefully crafting the right cliffhangers at the right moments, writers can create a story that is truly compelling and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/13/How-to-Make-Fiction-Interesting-by-Using-Cliffhangers-in-Chapters/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/13/How-to-Make-Fiction-Interesting-by-Using-Cliffhangers-in-Chapters/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Why Everyone Should Read Children's Books</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no denying that reading is one of the most enriching and enjoyable pastimes one can indulge in. But when it comes to literature, people often think of classics and literary fiction that can be quite complex and challenging. However, there’s one genre that often goes overlooked by adults: children’s books. These books may have been written for a younger audience, but they offer a multitude of benefits that people of all ages can appreciate. Here are five reasons why everyone should read children’s books.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They are often filled with profound wisdom&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of children’s books is often deceptive. These books may be written with a younger audience in mind, but they often contain messages that are relevant to people of all ages. For instance, “The Little Prince” by Saint Antoine deExupery is a story about a little prince who travels from planet to planet, meeting various inhabitants and learning valuable life lessons along the way. The book touches upon important themes such as love, friendship, and the meaning of life in a way that’s easy to understand and relatable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They inspire creativity and imagination&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children’s books are often fantastical and imaginative, taking readers on a journey to magical worlds and introducing them to eccentric characters. These books inspire creativity and spark the imagination, allowing readers to escape from the mundane realities of life for a while. For instance, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” by Lewis Carroll is a book that transports readers to a whimsical world filled with absurdity and nonsense. Reading such books can help unlock your inner creativity and imagination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They teach important life skills&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children’s books are not just entertaining, but they can also be educational. Many of these books are written with the intention of teaching children important life skills such as problem-solving, empathy, and self-confidence. For example, “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” by Dr Seuss is a book that encourages children to explore the world, take risks, and believe in themselves. These are important life skills that even adults can benefit from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They help you connect with your inner child&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;As we grow older, we often lose touch with our inner child. We become jaded, cynical, and sometimes even bitter. However, reading children’s books can help us reconnect with our inner child and rediscover the wonder and joy of life. These books offer a nostalgic and comforting quality that can transport us back to a simpler time in our lives. For instance, “Where the Wild Things Are” by Maurice Sendak is a book that takes readers on a wild and imaginative adventure, reminding us of the carefree days of childhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;They offer a fresh perspective on complex issues&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children’s books are often written in a way that’s easy to understand, even for complex issues. Many of these books tackle important social, political, and environmental issues in a way that’s accessible and engaging. For example, “The Lorax” by Dr Seuss is a book that tackles issues related to environmentalism, consumerism, and greed. It’s a story that can offer a fresh perspective on these complex issues and inspire readers to take action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are many reasons why everyone should read children’s books. From their profound wisdom to their ability to inspire creativity and imagination, these books offer something for everyone. So the next time you’re looking for something to read, consider picking up a children’s book. You might be surprised at just how much you can learn and how much joy you can experience from reading them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/10/Why-Everyone-Should-Read-Childrens-Books/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/10/Why-Everyone-Should-Read-Childrens-Books/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Importance of Literature in Society</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Literature has been an integral part of human civilization for centuries. From ancient epics to modern-day novels, literature has not only entertained but also educated and inspired people. In this blog, we will discuss the importance of literature in society by highlighting five key points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Literature helps us understand the human experience&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the essential functions of literature is to help us understand the human experience. Through novels, poems, and other literary works, we get to learn about different cultures, traditions, and perspectives. Literature can help us empathize with people who are different from us, as well as provide us with insights into the human condition. This can help promote greater understanding, respect, and tolerance among people of different backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Literature encourages critical thinking&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reading literature encourages critical thinking by exposing us to different ideas and ways of thinking. Through analyzing literary texts, we develop our ability to think deeply, question assumptions, and form our own opinions. Literature can challenge us to consider complex ethical and moral issues, which can help us become more thoughtful and responsible members of society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Literature preserves cultural heritage&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Literature also plays a crucial role in preserving cultural heritage. Many literary works, such as the epic Ramayana and Mahabharata, have endured for centuries and continue to be read today. These works help to preserve cultural traditions, beliefs, and values, providing us with a window into the past. Literature also allows us to appreciate the richness and diversity of human culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Literature promotes creativity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reading and studying literature can promote creativity by inspiring us to think outside the box. Many great writers and artists have drawn inspiration from literature, using it as a springboard for their own creative endeavours. Literature can help us to see the world in new ways, encouraging us to explore our own imaginations and come up with fresh ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Literature provides a form of escapism&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, literature provides a form of escapism that can be beneficial to our mental health. Reading can transport us to different worlds, allowing us to temporarily forget about our problems and concerns. This can be a valuable way to reduce stress and anxiety, providing us with a much-needed break from the demands of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, literature plays a vital role in society by promoting empathy, critical thinking, cultural heritage, creativity, and providing a form of escapism. By reading and studying literature, we can expand our horizons, broaden our perspectives, and gain a deeper appreciation for the world around us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/07/Importance-of-Literature-in-Society/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/07/Importance-of-Literature-in-Society/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Write a Good Thriller Novel</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Thriller is a popular genre that has captivated readers for decades. From heart-pumping action to psychological twists, thrillers are known for keeping readers on the edge of their seats. Writing a good thriller novel takes a combination of creativity, craft, and planning. In this blog post, we will explore some tips for how to write a good thriller novel that will leave readers wanting more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Start with a strong concept&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step in writing a good thriller novel is to start with a strong concept. This could be a unique plot twist, a gripping hook, or an interesting character that readers will care about. The concept should be compelling and should give readers a reason to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a compelling protagonist&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good thriller novel needs a strong protagonist that readers can root for. The protagonist should be someone readers can relate to and should have qualities that make them likeable and interesting. It’s important to make the protagonist flawed and vulnerable, but also resourceful and determined. This will make the reader invested in the character and keep them engaged throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop a well-rounded antagonist&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good thriller needs a well-rounded antagonist that is just as compelling as the protagonist. The antagonist should be someone who presents a real threat to the protagonist, but who is also complex and multidimensional. The antagonist should have motivations and a backstory that make them more than just a one-dimensional villain. This will make the story more interesting and give readers a reason to care about what happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create tension and suspense&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thriller novels are all about creating tension and suspense. This can be achieved through pacing, plot twists, and cliffhangers. It’s important to keep readers guessing and to always keep the stakes high. Tension and suspense can be built through a variety of techniques, such as using short, punchy sentences or creating unexpected plot twists that keep readers guessing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use dialogue to reveal character and advance the plot&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dialogue is an important tool in any novel, but it is especially important in thrillers. Dialogue can be used to reveal character, advance the plot, and build tension. Good dialogue should be snappy, realistic, and serve a purpose in the story. It’s important to avoid using dialogue as an info dump and instead use it to reveal the character and move the story forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Keep the pace fast and exciting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good thriller needs to have a fast pace that keeps readers engaged from beginning to end. This can be achieved through short chapters, cliffhangers, and plot twists that keep the reader guessing. It’s important to keep the momentum going throughout the story and to avoid slowing down the pace with unnecessary exposition or description.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create a satisfying ending&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending of a thriller novel is just as important as the beginning. The ending should be satisfying and should tie up all loose ends. It’s important to give readers a sense of closure and to make sure that the resolution is believable and consistent with the rest of the story. The ending should also be surprising and satisfying, leaving readers feeling like they have been on an exciting and satisfying journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, writing a good thriller novel takes a combination of creativity, craft, and planning. By starting with a strong concept, creating a compelling protagonist and antagonist, building tension and suspense, using dialogue effectively, keeping the pace fast and exciting, and creating a satisfying ending, writers can create a thriller that will keep readers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end. With practice and patience, anyone can write a great thriller novel that will captivate readers and leave them wanting more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/04/How-to-Write-a-Good-Thriller-Novel/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/04/How-to-Write-a-Good-Thriller-Novel/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Writing Descriptions with Colons and Semicolons</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing descriptions can be a challenging task for many writers. It requires a balance of creativity and precision to paint a picture that is both vivid and accurate. One way to achieve this balance is through the use of colons and semicolons. These punctuation marks can help writers create descriptive sentences that are both concise and detailed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Colons (:)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A colon is a punctuation mark that can be used to introduce a list, a quotation, or an explanation. When used correctly, a colon can help writers create descriptive sentences that provide specific details about a person, place, or thing. Here are some examples of how to use colons to write descriptions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example 1: The city was filled with vibrant colours: bright reds, deep blues, and golden yellows. In this example, the colon is used to introduce a list of colours that describe the city. By using a colon, the writer is able to convey the diversity and vibrancy of the city through a concise sentence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example 2: Her hair was a beautiful shade of brown: a warm, chestnut hue that glimmered in the sunlight. Here, the colon is used to provide a detailed description of the shade of brown in the person’s hair. By using a colon, the writer is able to create a vivid image of the hair that is both specific and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Semicolons (;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A semicolon is a punctuation mark that can be used to connect two closely related independent clauses. When used correctly, a semicolon can help writers create descriptive sentences that are both complex and precise. Here are some examples of how to use semicolons to write descriptions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example 1: The mountains were majestic; their peaks pierced the sky. In this example, the semicolon is used to connect two independent clauses that describe the mountains. By using a semicolon, the writer is able to create a sentence that is both descriptive and elegant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Example 2: The old man had weathered skin; his face was etched with lines that told the story of a long and hard life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, the semicolon is used to connect two independent clauses that describe the old man’s face. By using a semicolon, the writer is able to create a sentence that is both descriptive and emotive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Using Colons and Semicolons in Descriptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some additional tips for using colons and semicolons in descriptions:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use colons to introduce lists of descriptive details. This can help writers provide specific details about a person, place, or thing in a concise and organized way.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use semicolons to connect closely related independent clauses. This can help writers create complex sentences that provide a nuanced and detailed description.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Be mindful of the tone and style of your writing. Colons and semicolons can be used to create both formal and informal descriptions, depending on the context and the writer’s intentions.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Read your writing aloud to ensure that it flows smoothly and makes sense. This can help you identify any awkward or unclear sentences that may need to be revised.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, using colons and semicolons can be a powerful tool for writers who want to create descriptive sentences that are both precise and detailed. By using these punctuation marks correctly, writers can create sentences that are both elegant and informative, and that help readers to vividly imagine the people, places, and things they are reading about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>01 May 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/01/Writing-Descriptions-with-Colons-and-Semicolons/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/05/01/Writing-Descriptions-with-Colons-and-Semicolons/</guid> </item> <item> <title>House Of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A young family moves into a small home on Ash Tree Lane where they discover something is terribly wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;House of Leaves by Mark Danielewski is an extraordinary piece of literature that leaves a lasting impact on its readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to different voices in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Zampanò – He is a blind man, obsessed with his academic study of a film called The Navidson Record. It is the story of a young family who moved into a new home, which is somehow larger on the inside than on the outside. After some time, they discover a new room, dark as coal, with endless hallways, rooms that appear and disappear, and a mysterious force that seems to be lurking within the walls. Will Navidson along with a team of other people goes into the hallway, trying to find out something, anything that would settle their curious minds.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Johnny Truant – He is a tattoo parlour employee and is introduced to the apartment of the recently deceased Zampanò by his friend. On reaching the apartment he is taken away by all the research and analysis about The Navidson Record. As Johnny attempts to read through the content, he too finds himself obsessed with the subject and decides to create a decent manuscript out of it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;What follows is a book built upon multiple perspectives: Zampanò’s study of The Navidson Record, Johnny’s personal story in the footnote as he progresses through the manuscript, Editor’s notes. Moreover, at places, we find transcripts of other characters of The Navidson Record. It would not be a misstatement to say that the house itself is an important character in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along with the weird architecture of the house, the reader quickly realizes that they are in for an unconventional reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What stands out the most about House of Leaves is the writing style. Danielewski’s writing is simple, yet promising. He does not try to be poetic or flowery in his language, but he is still able to create a sense of urgency and tension that keeps the reader engaged throughout the book. The use of various writing techniques such as footnotes, different fonts, and even upside-down text adds to the unique reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the first page, House of Leaves hooks the reader with its eerie tone and mysterious storytelling. The very first page sets the stage for what is to come, warning readers that they are about to embark on a journey that is not for the faint of heart. The book is scary, but it is not a typical horror story. Instead, it plays with the reader’s mind, using psychological tricks to make them question what is real and what is not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every aspect of the book, including the cover design, makes sense in the context of the story. The book’s physical appearance, with its unusual font sizes, colors, and page layouts, is not just for show but is an essential part of the reading experience. Danielewski uses these elements to create a sense of chaos and disorientation, which aligns with the story’s theme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;House of Leaves is not a book that can be easily categorized. It has elements of horror, but it is also a love story, a psychological thriller, and a commentary on the human psyche. The story is layered, and it is up to the reader to make their own interpretation of what is happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, House of Leaves is a unique and unforgettable book that aligns with grand expectations. Danielewski’s writing style, use of unconventional techniques, and layered storytelling make for an enthralling read. The book is not for everyone. However, for those who are willing to take on the challenge, House of Leaves is a rewarding experience that will stay with them long after they have finished reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 Apr 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/30/House-of-leaves-by-Mark-Danielewski/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/30/House-of-leaves-by-Mark-Danielewski/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Power of Editing and Revising Your Work</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is a process that involves multiple stages, and one of the most important steps in that process is editing and revising your work. Many writers believe that the true magic of writing comes from the editing process. It is during this stage that you can take your raw ideas and mould them into a polished, cohesive piece of writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editing and revising are crucial because they help you to refine your work, eliminate errors, improve clarity and enhance the overall quality of your writing. Here are some of the ways in which editing and revising your work can help you become a better writer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve Clarity and Cohesion&lt;/strong&gt; One of the primary benefits of editing and revising your work is that it can help you to improve the clarity and cohesion of your writing. This means ensuring that your ideas flow logically and smoothly, making it easy for your readers to follow your arguments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the editing process, you can take a step back and analyze your writing objectively. This will allow you to identify areas where your writing may be confusing or unclear. You can then make changes to improve the flow and coherence of your writing, ensuring that your readers can easily understand your message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminate Errors&lt;/strong&gt; No matter how carefully you write, there will always be errors that slip through the cracks. Editing and revising your work is essential because it allows you to catch these errors before your readers do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes grammatical errors, punctuation mistakes, spelling errors, and more. By eliminating these errors, you can improve the readability of your writing and make it more professional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance the Quality of Your Writing&lt;/strong&gt; Editing and revising your work can also help you to enhance the overall quality of your writing. This means taking a critical eye on your work and looking for areas where you can improve your word choice, sentence structure, and overall style.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may find that some parts of your writing are weaker than others, and by identifying these areas, you can make changes to improve the quality of your writing as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Time&lt;/strong&gt; While it may seem counterintuitive, editing and revising your work can actually save you time in the long run. By taking the time to edit and revise your work thoroughly, you can catch errors and improve the quality of your writing, which means you won’t have to spend as much time making corrections later on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase Confidence&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, editing and revising your work can help to increase your confidence as a writer. When you know that you have taken the time to carefully review and refine your work, you can feel more confident in the quality of your writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This increased confidence can help you to produce better work in the future and can also help you to feel more comfortable sharing your writing with others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, editing and revising your work is an essential part of the writing process. It allows you to refine your ideas, improve clarity and cohesion, eliminate errors, enhance the quality of your writing, save time, and increase confidence. By taking the time to carefully edit and revise your work, you can become a more effective writer and produce writing that is clear, engaging, and professional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 Apr 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/28/The-Power-of-Editing-and-Revising-Your-Work/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/28/The-Power-of-Editing-and-Revising-Your-Work/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Why it's Important to Develop Good Reading Habits</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading is an essential skill that plays a vital role in our personal and professional growth.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced writer, there is always room for improvement. Here are five tips to help you master the art of creative writing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read widely: Reading is one of the most important things you can do to improve your writing. Read widely in the genre you are interested in and also outside your comfort zone. This will expose you to new ideas, writing styles, and perspectives, and help you develop your own unique voice as a writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Write regularly: Writing is a skill that requires practice, so make it a habit to write regularly. Set aside time each day or week to write, even if it’s just for a few minutes. This will help you develop discipline and improve your writing over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experiment with different styles: Don’t be afraid to experiment with different writing styles and techniques. Try writing in different genres, experimenting with different narrative structures, and exploring different themes. This will help you find your own unique voice and style as a writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edit and revise: Writing is a process, and it’s important to edit and revise your work. Once you have finished a piece, set it aside for a few days, then come back to it with fresh eyes. Look for areas that need improvement, and revise until you are satisfied with the final product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get feedback: Feedback is essential for improving your writing. Share your work with other writers, join a writing group or workshop, or hire a professional editor. This will help you identify areas that need improvement and give you the motivation to keep going.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, mastering the art of creative writing takes time and practice. By reading widely, writing regularly, experimenting with different styles, editing and revising, and getting feedback, you can develop your skills as a writer and create works that are engaging, powerful, and memorable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 Apr 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/11/How-to-Master-the-Art-of-Creative-Writing/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/11/How-to-Master-the-Art-of-Creative-Writing/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Improve Showing and Telling in Fiction</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to writing fiction, the balance between showing and telling is crucial. Showing refers to the use of vivid and specific sensory details to allow the reader to experience the story as if they were there, while telling is the use of exposition or summary to convey information to the reader. In order to create a well-crafted piece of fiction, writers need to learn how to balance showing and telling. Here are five ways to improve the showing and telling in your fiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use dialogue to show character relationships and emotions. Dialogue can be a powerful tool for showing character relationships and emotions. Instead of telling the reader that two characters are in love, show it through their interactions and dialogue. Let the reader hear the tone of their voices and the words they choose. This will allow the reader to experience the emotion for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use sensory details to show the setting and mood. Sensory details are a great way to immerse the reader in the setting and mood of the story. Rather than telling the reader that it’s a dark and stormy night, show them the sound of the rain on the roof, the smell of wet earth, and the feel of the cold wind on their skin. This will create a more vivid and immersive reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use action to show character traits. Action can reveal a lot about a character’s personality and traits. Instead of telling the reader that a character is brave, show them acting courageously. Show the character making difficult decisions, taking risks, and facing their fears. This will make the character more relatable and memorable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use internal thoughts to show character motivation. Internal thoughts are a great way to show a character’s motivations and inner struggles. Instead of telling the reader that a character wants to succeed, show them the character’s internal monologue as they push themselves to achieve their goals. This will create a deeper connection between the reader and the character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use a narrative summary to tell the backstory. While showing is often more effective than telling, there are times when a narrative summary is necessary. Backstory, for example, is often best told through a summary. Rather than showing a character’s entire life story, summarize the important details and let the reader fill in the gaps with their imagination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, balancing showing and telling is a key component of effective fiction writing. By using dialogue, sensory details, action, internal thoughts, and narrative summary, writers can create a rich and immersive reading experience for their audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Apr 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/07/How-to-Improve-Showing-and-Telling-in-Fiction/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/07/How-to-Improve-Showing-and-Telling-in-Fiction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Problems That Writers Struggle With and How to Deal With Them</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is a complex and challenging process, and even the most experienced writers struggle with various problems. Here are five common problems writers face, along with tips on how to deal with them:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writer’s block: One of the most common problems writers face is writer’s block, where they find themselves unable to generate ideas or put words on the page. To overcome writer’s block, try changing your environment, taking a break, or freewriting. Sometimes it can also be helpful to write about why you’re struggling to write in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Self-doubt: Many writers struggle with self-doubt, questioning whether their work is good enough or whether they have the talent to succeed. To overcome self-doubt, try focusing on the process of writing rather than the outcome, and seek support and encouragement from other writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lack of motivation: Sometimes writers struggle with a lack of motivation, feeling uninspired or unmotivated to write. To overcome this, try setting goals, creating a writing schedule, or finding a writing partner to hold you accountable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editing paralysis: Some writers struggle with editing paralysis, where they find themselves endlessly revising and never finishing a piece. To overcome this, try setting a deadline for yourself, seeking feedback from others, or breaking the editing process down into smaller, manageable tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time management: Finally, many writers struggle with time management, finding it difficult to balance writing with other responsibilities. To overcome this, try setting aside specific times each day or week to write, prioritizing your writing, and eliminating distractions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, writers face a range of challenges, from writer’s block to editing paralysis to self-doubt. By identifying these challenges and implementing strategies to overcome them, writers can develop the discipline and skills needed to produce their best work. Whether it’s setting goals, seeking feedback, or focusing on the process of writing rather than the outcome, there are many ways to overcome these common problems and thrive as a writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Apr 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/04/Problems-that-writers-struggle-with-and-how-to-deal-with-them/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/04/04/Problems-that-writers-struggle-with-and-how-to-deal-with-them/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Brilliance Beyond Love by Pramod Ponoth</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might be an incident that had played out many times before. Something that had been repeated countless times in history. But this time it was different. This time it was on a scale that had never been seen before. This time… it would not simply blow over. It will take you through the historic rambles of a love story to unfold that hidden future of the world. To safeguard the country’s peace, the government selected a specialised team. A team meant to uncover a secret that had been buried for ages in rubble and obscurity. A family is dragged into this mess unwillingly and now this unlikely group holds the key to unfolding this hidden mystery. Humankind would have never imagined that the technological growth in their backyard would impact them so significantly and mercilessly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will they be able to discover what was lost? Will they be able to protect that which they hold dear? Will they be able to unfold the mystery to save the country they call home? And more importantly…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will they be able to survive…?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Brilliance Beyond Love” by Pramod Ponoth is an intriguing novel that effectively blends history, technology, and fiction. The author has done an excellent job of creating describing the beauty of the Taj Mahal and its history in an engaging manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the strongest aspects of the novel is the well-crafted character-building. The characters are well-developed, with distinct personalities and motivations, which makes it easy for readers to connect with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The world-building is also impressive, as the author takes readers on a journey through the Taj Mahal, painting a vivid picture of the place and its history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The language used in the novel is easy to read and understand, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot revolves around a team trying to excavate hidden treasure in the Taj Mahal, while another team is sent to assist by the cultural ministry.

The introduction of AI policing and censoring in the second half of the novel is an unexpected twist, which is both interesting and scary to think about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only downside of the book is that the proofreading could have been better as there are some spelling and grammar errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, “Brilliance Beyond Love” is an interesting novel that will appeal to readers interested in history, science, and technology. The novel’s strengths lie in its good description, character-building, world-building, and easy language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>31 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/31/Brilliance-Beyond-Love-by-Pramod-Ponoth/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/31/Brilliance-Beyond-Love-by-Pramod-Ponoth/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Tips for Writing a Series</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a series can be a great way to create a lasting and beloved literary world. Not only do series provide an opportunity for readers to become deeply invested in characters and storylines, but they can also generate a loyal fan base. But for writers, the process of creating a series can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are five tips for writing a series that can help make the process smoother:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start with a Strong Concept: Before you begin writing a series, it is important to come up with a concept that is engaging and original. You should ask yourself questions such as: What will make this series stand out from other books in the same genre? What is the central conflict that will drive the story? How will the characters develop over time? By having a solid concept in place, you will have a better understanding of the direction you want to take the series forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create a Series Bible: A series bible is a comprehensive document that outlines all the important details of your series. This should include character bios, plot summaries, world-building information, and any other important details that you want to keep track of. Having a series bible will help you keep track of your characters and plot points throughout the series and ensure that your stories and characters remain consistent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Know Your Audience: It is important to know who your target audience is when writing a series. Knowing your audience can help you determine the tone, pacing, and themes that will best engage them. Understanding your readers will also help you create storylines that will captivate and surprise them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Map Out the Story Arcs: When writing a series, it is important to have an overall plan for how the story will progress. You should map out each character’s story arc, as well as the main plot points that will occur throughout the series. This will help you stay organized and ensure that your story is cohesive and engaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take Breaks Between Books: Writing a series can be a huge undertaking, so it is important to take breaks between books. Taking time away from the series will help you re-energize and come back with fresh ideas and perspectives. It can also help prevent you from getting too bogged down in the details and allow you to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these tips, you can make the process of writing a series smoother and more enjoyable. With a strong concept, a comprehensive series bible, an understanding of your target audience, and a plan for the story arcs, you can create an engaging and captivating world and series for your readers to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/26/Tips-for-Writing-a-Series/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/26/Tips-for-Writing-a-Series/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Sandorn's Prison by Thom Bedford</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Galactic war has ravaged the cosmos for three months.

Disaster strikes, however, and the rescue attempt fails. Distress signals are intercepted by Exeter Station, where Commander Tanic Sandorn and his crew are called upon to do what the first mission couldn’t. Save the tortured prisoners of war.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to be a part of this rescue mission, Sandorn and the rest of his crew will need to fall in line behind a corrupt, authoritarian fleet commander, who is willing to get them all killed for the sake of his own reputation.

The world-building is exceptional, with a deep-seated conflict between the Alliance and the Union factions, and the introduction of a brewing problem that adds to the suspense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development of Tanic Sandorn is a standout feature, as he navigates the challenges of being a leader torn between following orders and doing what is right. His choices and sacrifices show his deep sense of morality, making him a character that readers can’t help but admire. Additionally, the supporting characters are equally well-developed, each bringing their unique perspective and motivation to the narrative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pacing is another strength of the novel, with a smooth and consistent flow from start to finish. The twists and turns keep the plot fresh, and the author’s adept handling of tension and pacing creates a story that is both exciting and emotionally engaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, Sandorn’s Prison is a triumph of space opera and a tribute to Thom Bedford’s skills as a storyteller.

The challenge for non-fiction writers is creating compelling and engaging topics that will capture the reader’s attention and keep them interested throughout the article or book. In this blog, we’ll explore five ways to create such topics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on the reader’s pain points&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most effective ways to create engaging non-fiction topics is by focusing on the reader’s pain points. Identify the problems or challenges that your readers are facing, and craft a topic that speaks directly to those issues. For instance, if you are writing about financial management, you could create a topic such as “5 easy steps to take control of your finances and reduce stress.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; Storytelling is a powerful tool that can make even the most mundane topics interesting. By using anecdotes or real-life examples, you can make your non-fiction writing relatable and engaging. For example, if you are writing about leadership, you could use stories of successful leaders to illustrate your points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a unique angle&lt;/strong&gt; One way to create a compelling topic for non-fiction is to take a unique angle. Look for a perspective that hasn’t been explored before or an approach that is different from the norm. For instance, if you are writing about nutrition, you could take a unique angle by focusing on how certain foods can boost your brainpower.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use provocative or intriguing titles&lt;/strong&gt; Provocative or intriguing titles can grab the reader’s attention and make them want to read more. Use a title that piques the reader’s interest, such as “The surprising benefits of boredom” or “Why failure is the key to success.” However, it is important to ensure that the title accurately reflects the content of the article or book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address current trends or issues&lt;/strong&gt; Writing about current trends or issues is an excellent way to create engaging non-fiction topics. Look for topics that are currently making headlines or that are on the minds of your readers. For instance, if you are writing about environmental sustainability, you could address the impact of climate change on food production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, creating compelling and engaging topics for non-fiction writing requires careful thought and consideration. By focusing on the reader’s pain points, using storytelling, taking a unique angle, using provocative or intriguing titles, and addressing current trends or issues, you can craft topics that will capture your readers’ attention and keep them engaged throughout your article or book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/20/How-to-Create-Compelling-Topics-for-Non-Fiction/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/20/How-to-Create-Compelling-Topics-for-Non-Fiction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Use Description to Enhance the Story</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;When writing a story, description is an important part of the narrative. The way a writer describes a setting, character, or object can give readers a better understanding of the story. It can also add depth and texture to the narrative, making it more interesting and engaging. Here are five ways to use description to enhance a story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use vivid language&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using vivid language is an effective way to bring a story to life. Instead of simply saying “the room was small,” try using phrases like “the cramped room barely had enough room to move.” Instead of saying a character is “angry,” try describing his “fury-filled face,” or her “shaking hands.” Using vivid language can make a story more engaging and help readers to better imagine the scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Describe the setting&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;The setting of a story is an important part of the narrative. Describing the setting in detail can help readers to better visualize the scene. Describing the smells, sounds, and textures of the setting can also help create a more immersive experience for the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Describe characters&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Describing a character’s physical appearance is an effective way to bring them to life in the story. Describing their clothes, hairstyle, and posture can help readers to better visualize the character. It is also important to describe their personality traits and emotions. Describing how a character speaks and acts can reveal more about their personality, and help readers to better understand their motivations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use sensory details&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using sensory details is an effective way to make a story more engaging. Describing how a character feels, smells, tastes, or hears something can help to bring the story to life. For example, instead of simply saying “the room smelled musty,” try adding more detail by saying “the musty smell of mold filled the room.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use figurative language&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using figurative language can help to create a more vivid image in the reader’s mind. Figurative language includes metaphors, similes, hyperboles, and personification. For example, instead of simply saying “the wind was blowing,” try saying “the wind howled like a wild animal.” Figurative language can help to make a story more interesting and engaging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By using these five techniques, writers can use description to enhance their story and make it more engaging for readers. Vivid language, sensory details, and figurative language can all help to bring the story to life and make it more interesting. Describing the setting and characters can also help readers to better understand the story and visualize the scene. Using description effectively can help to make a story more engaging and enjoyable for readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>14 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/14/How-to-Use-Description-to-Enhance-the-Story/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/14/How-to-Use-Description-to-Enhance-the-Story/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Combine Different Genres to Write Better Fiction</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Fiction writing is a creative process that allows authors to create interesting and unique stories.

Combining science fiction with horror elements can create an exciting and suspenseful story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fantasy &amp;amp; Romance: Fantasy and romance are two genres that can be combined to create an incredible story.

This combination can provide readers with a thrilling and captivating story as they try to solve the mystery. For example, Gone Girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Literary Fiction &amp;amp; Adventure: Literary fiction is a genre that focuses on character development and complex themes. Combining literary fiction with adventure elements can create a captivating story with a unique and exciting plot.

Here are five key points to keep in mind when crafting a narrative structure for your next piece of fiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Establish the Setting: An important factor in narrative structure is establishing the setting. Setting includes not only the physical location but also the time period and cultural context of the story. The setting should be described in a way that helps readers imagine the world in which the story takes place. This will help create an immersive experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Introduce Your Characters: Characters are the heart of any good story. It is important to take the time to introduce each character and establish their motivations, goals, and conflicts. This will make them more believable and relatable to readers. Developing strong characters is essential to building an engaging narrative structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Establish the Conflict: Conflict is essential for a good story. It is the source of tension that drives the narrative forward. Without conflict, the story will feel flat and uninteresting. Establishing a strong conflict early in the narrative structure will help to engage readers and keep them invested in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plot Structure: A good narrative structure includes a well-crafted plot. The plot should move the story forward and build tension. There should be a clear beginning, middle and end with a satisfying resolution. A strong plot structure is essential for creating an engaging story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thematic Elements: Good fiction should have a clear theme. The theme should be woven throughout the story and help to guide the narrative structure. A strong thematic element will help to engage readers and make the story more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding these five key points will help you craft a narrative structure that is engaging and satisfying to readers. Taking the time to develop a strong setting, characters, conflict, plot structure and thematic elements will help to create an immersive and enjoyable experience for readers. With a little practice and patience, you can create a compelling piece of fiction that readers will enjoy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/08/How-to-Establish-Narrative-Structure-in-Fiction/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/08/How-to-Establish-Narrative-Structure-in-Fiction/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Utilize the Exclamation Point</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;The exclamation point is a powerful piece of punctuation.

When used effectively, they can help to create a more realistic and engaging narrative. However, it’s easy to overuse dialogue tags or use them in a way that detracts from the story. Here are some strategies for writing dialogue tags that will help you create an effective, engaging narrative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use Action Instead of Dialogue Tags&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to avoid overusing dialogue tags is to use action instead. Rather than simply saying “he said” or “she asked,” add a physical action that conveys the emotion of the speaker. For example, instead of saying “he said,” you could write “he sighed.” This gives the reader a better sense of the speaker’s emotion and can help move the story along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Don’t Overuse Dialogue Tags&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that dialogue tags are not necessary for every sentence. In fact, overusing dialogue tags can be distracting to the reader and can take away from the story. Instead, focus on using just the dialogue tags that are necessary to convey the speaker’s emotion or the tone of the conversation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use Varying Dialogue Tags&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;When writing dialogue tags, it’s important to use a variety of tags to keep the reader engaged. For example, instead of relying on “he said” and “she said” throughout the story, try using other tags such as “he asked,” “she whispered,” or “he yelled,” but do not over do it as mentioned in the previous point. This will help to create a more dynamic story and will keep the reader engaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use Dialogue Tags to Convey Emotion&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dialogue tags can be used to convey emotion, so use them to your advantage. For example, if a character is feeling frustrated, you can use dialogue tags such as “he snapped” or “she shouted.” This will give the reader a better sense of the character’s emotions and will help to create a more engaging story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use Dialogue Tags Sparingly&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s important to remember that dialogue tags should be used sparingly. If used too often, they can become distracting and can take away from the story. Instead, focus on using only the dialogue tags that are necessary to convey the emotion of the speaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these strategies for writing dialogue tags, you can create a more engaging narrative that will keep your reader hooked. Remember to use action instead of dialogue tags, don’t overuse dialogue tags, use varying dialogue tags, use dialogue tags to convey emotion, and use dialogue tags sparingly. With these strategies, you’ll be able to write dialogue tags that will add flavor and emotion to your story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>01 Mar 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/01/Strategies-for-Writing-Dialogue-Tags/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/03/01/Strategies-for-Writing-Dialogue-Tags/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference between Stationary &amp; Stationery</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;We often hear the words stationary and stationery being used interchangeably, but they are actually two different words with different meanings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stationary (with an “a”) refers to something that is not moving or changing. For example, planets are stationary. Stationary also refers to things that remain the same over time, such as the stationary population of a city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stationery (with an “e”), on the other hand, refers to paper and writing materials, such as envelopes, writing paper, and pens. Stationery is used for handwriting letters, as well as for writing notes and memos. For example, I need to buy stationery from the shop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The words stationary and stationery are often confused because they are pronounced the same. However, their meanings are quite different and should not be used interchangeably. Stationary is used to describe something that is not moving or changing, while stationery is used to refer to paper and writing materials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/27/Difference-between-stationary-stationery/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/27/Difference-between-stationary-stationery/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference between Farther &amp; Further</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Farther and further are two words in the English language that are often confused and used interchangeably. Although they are related, they are not the same words, and they do not mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Farther is an adjective used to describe physical distance. For example, your house is farther away from the store than mine is. Further is an adverb used to describe an additional amount of time, distance, or degree. For example, I need to research this topic further before I can make a decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Farther implies a larger physical distance between two places, while further implies an additional amount of some kind. Therefore, you can use farther if you are talking about how two physical locations are far apart. You can use further to talk about an additional amount of something, such as difficulty, time, or distance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further can also be used metaphorically. For example, if you are trying to make a decision, you can say that you need to take it further. This means that you need to think about the decision in more depth. You can also use further to talk about a process that is taking a long time, such as a legal dispute that is dragging on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, farther and further are two words that are related but have different meanings. Farther is used to describe physical distance, while further is used to describe an additional amount of something or metaphorically to talk about processes or decisions that need to be taken further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/25/Difference-between-farther-further/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/25/Difference-between-farther-further/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Valmikis Women: Five Tales from Ramayana by Anand Neelakantan</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would King Dasharatha even have his coveted sons were it not for the sacrifice of his daughter Shanta? Was Manthara an evil, conniving handmaid to the queen, or a loving mother who tried to protect her ward from palace intrigues? How did Meenakshi of the beautiful eyes transform into the embodiment of ugliness and immoral lust? In an epic that revolves around the life of a righteous prince, what role do the women play? As bestselling author Anand Neelakantan peels back the layers of Valmiki’s timeless saga, these stories of ambition, love, devotion and courage shine through, inviting readers to look at the women anew. Lovers, sisters, wives and mothers who hold a complex epic together—these are the women of Valmiki’s Ramayana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite modern Ramayan often failing to depict female characters in any meaningful detail, the portrayals that do exist tend to be highly negative. Sita has been victimized, while Manthra, Meenakshi, and Tataka have been villainized without nuance. Even Shanta, who plays a significant role in the story, is largely unknown to most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anand Neelakantan’s Valmiki’s Women is an intriguing tale of the lives of these five women in this Indian epic. It is a captivating and informative read that sheds light on the hidden stories of female characters in the Valmiki Ramayan. Neelakantan’s novel is filled with vivid descriptions and real and relatable characters. He effectively uses his storytelling to explore the lives of these women and their struggles with injustice, ambition, and courage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novel is written in an engaging and accessible style that makes it enjoyable for both new and experienced readers of Indian mythology. Neelakantan does a fantastic job of breathing life into the almost unknown and always misunderstood characters of the epic. The setting is also well-developed, giving readers a sense of the atmosphere and culture of ancient India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bhoomija: Valmiki’s idea to write Ramayan was brought to life in the first chapter, Bhoomija. Here, the reader is presented with a glimpse of the origins of this illustrious and timeless tale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shanta: The least known character of Ramayan is Shanta. She is Lord Rama’s elder sister who was given up for adoption by Dashratha. However, she plays crucial role in the yajna, which enables the birth of Ram and his brothers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manthara: Manthra, the key figure behind the fateful exile of Rama, Sita, and Laxmana, has a story that predates even the birth of Ram and the marriage of Kaikeyi. This chapter delves into her journey, starting in Kaikeyi’s youth when her father had to find someone to look after her. Through this, we witness the formation of the relationship between Manthra and Kaikeyi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tataka: Tataka is the story of a cursed Yaksha (Nature Spirit) who becomes a Rakshasa (Demon). Tataka’s destiny was sealed when she was slain by Rama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meenakshi: Because of the famous scene of Lakshmana cutting off Shurpanakha’s nose, Meenakshi, or Shurpanakha as she is famously known, is often portrayed as a villainous character. However, this narrative offers readers the opportunity to reflect on the scene and gain a newfound understanding of the character and the situation beyond the traditional right vs wrong dichotomy that we have been accustomed to. My favorite story of all, this narrative offers a unique perspective on a misjudged character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Valmiki’s Women is an absolute must-read for anyone interested in Indian mythology. Neelakantan’s writing is captivating and his characters are truly engaging, providing readers with a completely new and unique perspective on the lives of women in Ramayan. This book is highly recommended!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/23/Valmikis-Women-by-Anand-Neelakantan/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/23/Valmikis-Women-by-Anand-Neelakantan/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference Between Who, Who's, Whose, Whom</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever found yourself stuck between the different uses of who’s, whose, who, and whom, you’re not alone. English grammar can be a tricky thing, and these four words are often confusing when it comes to choosing the right one. Let’s break down the differences between these words and explain when to use each one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who is a subject pronoun used when asking a question. For example, you would say, “Who ate the last cookie?” or “Who is coming to the movie?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who’s is a contraction of the words “who is” or “who has.” For example, you would say, “Who’s coming to the party?” or “Who’s been to the store?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whose is a possessive pronoun used to describe something that belongs to someone. For example, you would say, “Whose shoes are these?” or “Whose wallet is this?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, whom is an object pronoun used in questions. For example, you would say, “To whom did you give the book?” or “Whom did you call?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By understanding the differences between who’s, whose, who, and whom, you can now easily choose the right word for the right occasion. Now that you know the difference between these four words, you can confidently use them in your written and spoken English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/16/Difference-between-who-whos-whose-whom/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/16/Difference-between-who-whos-whose-whom/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Craft Realistic Settings</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a story set in a believable, realistic setting can be one of the most challenging parts of writing fiction. However, creating an immersive, vivid setting is essential for a successful story, as readers must be able to imagine the world you’ve created and become fully invested in your characters’ lives. Here are five ways to help writers craft realistic settings for their stories:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research the Facts: Researching the facts about the location and time period in which your story is set is essential for creating a realistic setting. This includes researching geographical, political, and social details about the area, as well as any relevant historical events. Doing thorough research will ensure that the details in your story are accurate, and that your setting is believable and immersive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use Descriptive Language: Descriptive language can help bring a setting to life, allowing readers to visualize the world that you’ve created. Choose words that evoke the senses, and pay attention to the details. Describe the smells, sights, and sounds of the environment, and pay attention to the flora and fauna of the area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Draw on Your Own Experiences and Observations: Drawing on your own experiences and observations can help make a setting more believable. If you’ve visited the area in which your story is set, draw on the memories of the sights and sounds you encountered. If you haven’t, draw on the memories of other places you’ve been to, or research pictures and videos of the area to help bring your setting to life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make Use of Dialogue: Dialogue is a great way to add realism to a setting. Characters’ conversations can reveal important details about their environment, such as the way people speak, the slang they use, and the customs and beliefs of their culture. Dialogue can also be used to reveal the characters’ relationships to one another, as well as to the setting itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Show, Don’t Tell: Showing, not telling, is an important writing technique that can be used to create an immersive setting. Rather than simply telling readers that the setting is sunny, for example, use descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of the sun’s warmth and light. Showing the setting in action, rather than simply telling readers about it, can help make it come alive in the readers’ minds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;By using these five tips, writers can craft realistic settings that will draw readers in and transport them to another world. Researching the facts, using descriptive language, drawing on your own experiences and observations, making use of dialogue, and showing rather than telling are all essential elements of creating a believable setting. With these tips, writers can ensure that their stories will have vivid, immersive settings that readers won’t be able to forget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/06/How-to-Craft-Realistic-Settings/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/06/How-to-Craft-Realistic-Settings/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Creating Unique Characters, Not Opposites</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Making characters opposite of each other is not equal to making them unique.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When creating characters, writers should be mindful of not just giving their characters polar opposite traits. Doing so can make them one-dimensional and cause readers to be less invested in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having characters with opposite traits can be used as a tool in storytelling, but it should be done sparingly. Rather than relying solely on polar opposites, they should be given traits that are both positive and negative, as well as a variety of strengths and weaknesses. This will give them more depth and make them more relatable to the audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Giving characters realistic motivations and goals can also help to create a more engaging narrative. They should have their own set of flaws and aspirations that are not just the opposite of another character’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, writers should strive to create characters that are complex and believable, rather than just a collection of conflicting traits. Doing so will help to make the story more interesting and enjoyable for readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>05 Feb 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/05/Creating-Unique-Characters-Not-Opposites/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/02/05/Creating-Unique-Characters-Not-Opposites/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Craft Effective Dialogues</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Dialogue is an essential part of any story, and it helps to bring characters and the plot to life.

Here are five ways to help writers craft effective dialogue:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choose words that are specific to the character. The words that you choose for each character should be specific to that character and bring out their individual personality and traits. This will help to create unique and believable characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create dialogue that adds to the story. The dialogue should move the plot forward and help to reveal the characters’ motivations and emotions. Every line of dialogue should be meaningful and provide insight into the character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use slang and colloquialisms. Using slang and colloquialisms will help to make the dialogue more authentic and realistic. They will also help to give each character a distinct voice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure the dialogue is natural. The dialogue should sound like it is coming from a real person. Avoid using overly formal language or too many technical or difficult words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read the dialogue aloud. This can help to ensure that the dialogue sounds natural and flows well. It will also help to identify any awkward or unnatural phrases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these tips, you can become a master of dialogue and create unique and believable characters.

While it’s true that apostrophes can be tricky, they’re not impossible to use correctly. To help you out, here’s a guide on how to use apostrophes correctly in your writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. To indicate possession:&lt;/strong&gt; Apostrophes are used to indicate possession or ownership. To use apostrophes correctly in these situations, it’s important to remember that the apostrophe comes before the “s” (except in unusual cases like the possessive pronouns its and yours). For example, the correct way to write “the cat’s tail” is with an apostrophe before the “s”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. To indicate missing letters:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to indicating possession, apostrophes can also be used to indicate missing letters in a word or phrase. This is known as a contraction. For example, the phrase “do not” becomes “don’t” when written with an apostrophe. Similarly, the phrase “cannot” becomes “can’t” when written with an apostrophe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. To indicate a plural possessive noun:&lt;/strong&gt; When a plural noun is being used to indicate possession, an apostrophe and an “s” should be added to the end of the noun. For example, “The students’ desks were all cleared off.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. NOT To indicate a plural form:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s also important to note that apostrophes are NOT used to make a noun plural. For example, the correct way to write “cats” is without an apostrophe. Similarly, the correct way to write “apples” is without an apostrophe. &lt;strong&gt;5. Possessive Pronouns and Adjectives:&lt;/strong&gt; Apostrophes are NOT used with possessive pronouns, such as “his”, “hers”, or “its”. For example: “The cat licked its paw”. Possessive adjectives, such as “my”, “your”, and “our”, do NOT use apostrophes in standard English usage. For example: “My book” or “Our house”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By following these simple rules, you can use apostrophes correctly in your writing to add clarity and precision to your writing. Remember, apostrophes are used to indicate possession or ownership, contractions, and a possessive relationship between two nouns. They are not used to make nouns plural. With a little practice, you’ll be able to use apostrophes correctly in no time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/18/How-to-Use-Apostrophes-Correctly/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/18/How-to-Use-Apostrophes-Correctly/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Use Pacing Techniques to Increase Tension</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;When writing a story, pacing is a critical factor in creating tension with your readers. It is the difference between a boring narrative that fails to draw readers in and one that keeps them turning the pages. Good pacing techniques can help writers keep their readers engaged and increase the tension in their stories. Here are five tips to help writers use pacing techniques to increase tension.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Vary the length of your scenes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Varying the length of your scenes can be an effective way to keep readers engaged in your story. Longer scenes can be used to build tension, while shorter scenes can be used to keep the pace moving and create suspense. The length of your scenes should be determined by the type of story you want to tell and the type of tension you want to create.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Use dialogue to build tension.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dialogue can be a powerful tool for increasing tension in a story. The words and the way characters interact can reveal a lot about their relationships and the stakes of the story. Dialogue can also be used to build suspense, by having characters ask questions or make statements that carry a hint of menace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Increase the stakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increasing the stakes in your story can be a great way to increase the tension. Make sure the consequences of the characters’ actions are clear and that the stakes are high. This will keep readers invested in the story and will make them feel like the outcome is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Utilize cliffhangers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cliffhangers are a great way to add tension and suspense to a story. They can be used to create suspense by ending a chapter or scene with a shocking statement or a question that the readers will want to see answered. This will leave them wanting to know what happens next and will keep them reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Use foreshadowing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Foreshadowing is a great way to add tension and suspense to a story. It provides clues to the readers about what is to come, and allows them to anticipate what is going to happen. Foreshadowing can be used to create a feeling of dread or anticipation in the readers and make them more eager to find out what happens next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are just a few tips to help writers use pacing techniques to increase tension. Pacing is an important factor in creating tension and suspense in a story, and by using these tips, writers can make sure their stories are engaging and keep readers turning the pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/16/How-to-Use-Pacing-Techniques-to-Increase-Tension/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/16/How-to-Use-Pacing-Techniques-to-Increase-Tension/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference Between Principal &amp; Principle</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;The terms principal and principle are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings and uses in the English language. While they sound similar and even have similar spellings, they have different definitions and uses. Knowing the difference between them can help you to use them correctly in your writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Principal is an adjective that means most important or foremost. It can also be used as a noun to refer to the head of a school or a person in a position of authority. For example, “The principal of the school is Mrs. Smith.” It can also be used as an adverb to mean primarily or mainly. For example, “He invested his money principal in stocks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, principle is a noun that refers to a fundamental truth or law. It can also refer to a moral rule or standard of behavior. For example, “Honesty is a principle that everyone should live by.” It can also be used to refer to a rule or law that governs a certain area, such as “the principle of supply and demand.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main difference between principal and principle is that one refers to a person or thing (principal) and the other refers to a rule or law (principle).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some examples to further illustrate the difference between principal and principle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you were talking about a school, you would say “the principal of the school is Mrs. Smith.” Here, principal is referring to the person who is in charge of the school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you were talking about a moral rule or standard of behavior, you would say “honesty is a principle that everyone should live by.” Here, principle is referring to a moral rule or standard of behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing the difference between the two can help you to use them correctly in your writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/15/Difference-between-principal-principle/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/15/Difference-between-principal-principle/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference Between Weather &amp; Whether</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the words “weather” and “whether” may seem similar, but they have very different meanings and uses. It’s important to understand the difference between them to make sure you’re using them correctly in your written and spoken English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather&lt;/strong&gt; is a noun that refers to the state of the atmosphere at a particular place and time. Weather can include factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For example, you might say, “The weather in Seattle has been cold and rainy lately.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether&lt;/strong&gt; is a conjunction that is used to introduce two or more alternatives. For example, you might say, “I’m not sure whether I should go to the beach or stay home this weekend.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weather has to do with the physical conditions of the atmosphere, while whether is used to make comparisons or to express a choice. This is why it’s important to pay attention to the context of how these words are used.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, it’s always best to consult a dictionary or grammar guide to make sure you’re using the right word in the right context. Understanding the difference between weather and whether is essential to being a proficient English speaker and writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>14 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/14/Difference-between-weather-whether/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/14/Difference-between-weather-whether/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Stay Motivated to Write</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing can be a daunting task, especially when you don’t feel motivated. Whether you’re a student, a professional writer, or someone who just loves to write, staying motivated is key to producing quality work. Here are 7 strategies for staying motivated to write:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set specific, achievable goals:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of setting a general goal to “write more,” set specific goals that you can track and measure. For example, “write 500 words every day” or “finish a draft of my article by Friday.” Having specific goals will give you something to work towards and help you stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a writing schedule:&lt;/strong&gt; Find a time that works best for you to write and make it a consistent part of your routine. Whether it’s first thing in the morning, during your lunch break, or after dinner, having a set time to write will help you stay on track and motivated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find an accountability partner:&lt;/strong&gt; Having someone to hold you accountable for meeting your writing goals can be a great motivator. Find a friend, colleague, or writing group to check in with and share your progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a supportive writing environment:&lt;/strong&gt; Your surroundings can have a big impact on your motivation to write. Make sure you have a quiet, comfortable space to work and eliminate distractions as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take breaks and reward yourself:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s important to take breaks and give yourself time to recharge. Celebrate your achievements, no matter how small, and reward yourself for meeting your writing goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set deadlines:&lt;/strong&gt; Deadlines can be a great motivator. Set deadlines for yourself and work towards meeting them. This will help you stay focused and motivated to get your writing done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your writing motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; What motivates you to write? Is it a sense of accomplishment? Sharing your work with others? Knowing that your writing can make a difference? Identify what motivates you and use it to drive you forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, staying motivated to write takes time and effort, and it’s okay if you have days where you don’t feel like writing. Just try to stay focused and consistent, and you’ll be well on your way to achieving your writing goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/10/How-to-Stay-Motivated-to-Write/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/10/How-to-Stay-Motivated-to-Write/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Craft Believable Characters</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Crafting believable characters is a crucial aspect of writing fiction. Whether you are working on a short story, a novel, or a screenplay, taking the time to carefully develop your characters will pay off in the end. Here are seven tips for crafting believable characters:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Start with the basics.&lt;/strong&gt; When creating a new character, it’s important to consider the basics, such as their name, age, gender, occupation, and physical appearance. These details will help you to get a sense of who your character is and how they might behave.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Give your characters flaws and quirks.&lt;/strong&gt; No one is perfect, and neither should your characters be. Giving your characters flaws and quirks will make them more believable and relatable. For example, a character who is overly perfectionistic might have a hard time delegating tasks, while a character with a short temper might struggle with impulse control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Make your characters dynamic.&lt;/strong&gt; Static characters, or those who do not change over the course of the story, can be boring. To make your characters more interesting, give them goals, motivations, and conflicts that drive them to change and grow over the course of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Use dialogue to reveal character.&lt;/strong&gt; Your characters’ dialogue can reveal a lot about their personality, values, and beliefs. Pay attention to how your characters speak and what they say, and use this information to further develop their character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Avoid stereotypes.&lt;/strong&gt; While it can be tempting to rely on stereotypes when creating characters, it’s important to avoid falling into this trap. Instead, take the time to carefully consider your characters’ unique traits and characteristics, and avoid relying on cliches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Consider your characters’ backstories.&lt;/strong&gt; Your characters’ past experiences and relationships can shape who they are and how they behave. Taking the time to consider and develop your characters’ backstories can help to make them more believable and three-dimensional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Show, don’t tell.&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of simply telling your readers that your character is kind, show them through their actions and dialogue. This will help your readers to better understand and connect with your characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crafting believable characters is an essential part of writing fiction, and it takes time and effort to get it right. By following these tips, you can create characters that are complex, dynamic, and believable. Your readers will be able to connect with your characters on a deeper level, and your story will be all the more engaging as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/06/How-to-Craft-Believable-Characters/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/06/How-to-Craft-Believable-Characters/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Write an Engaging Plot Twist</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Plot twists are essential elements of storytelling. They transform the narrative and keep audiences engaged. A good plot twist can be the difference between a great story and a mediocre one. Here are five tips for writing an engaging plot twist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Delay the reveal.&lt;/strong&gt; If a plot twist is revealed too soon, it can deflate the suspense. Instead, let the audience build up anticipation by delaying the reveal until the right moment. This will make the twist all the more surprising and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Make it unpredictable.&lt;/strong&gt; Your plot twist should come out of left-field and shake up the audience’s expectations. If the twist is too predictable, it won’t have the desired effect. Try to think of a twist that is both unexpected and logical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep it small.&lt;/strong&gt; While a big twist can be effective, sometimes it’s better to keep it small and subtle. A subtle twist can be just as powerful, if not more so, than a more obvious one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make it character-driven.&lt;/strong&gt; A twist should always be connected to the characters and their motivations. It should be something that the characters would do, and that makes sense in the context of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Don’t make it a deus ex machina.&lt;/strong&gt; A deus ex machina is when a plot twist is introduced out of nowhere to resolve a conflict. This is often seen as a cop-out and can leave audiences feeling cheated. Try to avoid this by making sure the twist is set up earlier in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing an engaging plot twist can be tricky, but it’s an essential part of crafting a compelling story. By following these tips, you can ensure your plot twist is both surprising and satisfying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>05 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/05/How-to-write-an-engaging-plot-twist/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/05/How-to-write-an-engaging-plot-twist/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Build an Emotional Connection with Readers</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing is an art form, but its ultimate purpose is to make a connection with the reader. A good story should evoke emotion, captivate the reader, and draw them in to the story. As a writer, it is essential to build an emotional connection with readers in order to create a powerful and lasting impact. Here are five ways for writers to build an emotional connection with readers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Write with passion The most powerful stories are written with passion and emotion. Write from your heart and be honest with yourself and your readers. Show your readers that you care about the story and its characters by conveying your feelings on the page. Use vivid language and descriptions that evoke emotion and help your readers connect with the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create characters that readers can relate to Readers are more likely to connect with characters that they can relate to. Create characters that have flaws, hopes, dreams, and struggles that readers can identify with. Show the character’s growth over the course of the story and make sure that their actions are understandable and believable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Show, don’t tell Rather than simply telling the reader how the character feels, try to show it. Use physical actions, gestures, and body language to convey the character’s emotions and create an emotional connection with the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use sensory details Using sensory details can help readers visualize the story and connect with it on an emotional level. Describe the setting in detail, focusing on sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. This will help readers to feel as if they are part of the story and increase the emotional impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evoke emotion The best way to build an emotional connection with readers is to evoke emotion. Use words that evoke emotion, such as fear, joy, sadness, and hope. Make sure to use the emotions appropriately in the story and create an emotional roller coaster for the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;By using these techniques, writers can create powerful stories that will engage and captivate readers. It is essential to build an emotional connection with readers in order to create a lasting impact. Writing with passion, creating relatable characters, showing instead of telling, using sensory details, and evoking emotion are all excellent ways to build an emotional connection with readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/04/How-to-Build-an-Emotional-Connection-with-Readers/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/04/How-to-Build-an-Emotional-Connection-with-Readers/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Difference Between Insure &amp; Ensure</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to words, insure and ensure often cause confusion. In fact, many people use the words interchangeably, but there is a difference. While insure and ensure both mean to make something sure or certain, they are used in different contexts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insure&lt;/strong&gt; is a term that many people are familiar with, as it’s used in the world of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, such as life insurance or car insurance, you are insuring yourself against a certain risk. This means that, should something happen that causes you to lose money, your insurance policy will cover the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, is used in a more general sense. It’s typically used to describe the act of making sure that something will happen. For example, you might ensure that a room is clean before you host a party or ensure that a task is completed on time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, insure is mainly used in the context of insurance, while ensure is used in more general ways. This means that you can insure your car, but you can also ensure that your car is in good condition before you go on a road trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that both words can be used in a variety of ways, and that they don’t always mean the same thing. For example, while you can insure a car, you can also ensure that a car is safe and reliable. In this case, you are not purchasing an insurance policy, but rather making sure that the car is in good condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, insure and ensure are two words with different meanings and usages. Insure is mainly used in the context of insurance, while ensure is used in more general ways. It’s important to understand the difference between the two words in order to use them correctly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/03/Difference-between-insure-ensure/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/03/Difference-between-insure-ensure/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How to Overcome Writer's Block</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;Writer’s block is a common struggle for many writers, especially for those who write for a living. It can be a major obstacle to any writer, regardless of experience. It is incredibly frustrating and can lead to a lack of creativity and productivity in your writing. Fortunately, there are steps that you can take to overcome this roadblock and get back to writing with enthusiasm and creativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a Break:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s easy to get frustrated when you’re stuck and unable to write. Instead of dwelling on it, take a break. Do something else for a while and give your mind a chance to reset. Take a walk, watch a movie, read a book, or do something else that you enjoy. When you come back to your writing later, you’ll feel refreshed and ready to go. Taking a break from writing can help clear your mind and provide the much-needed space to come up with new ideas. It can help you refocus and feel more inspired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change the Setting:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re having trouble writing, try changing the location of your writing. Go to a different room, or take your laptop to a café or the park. You may find that the new environment helps to spark some new ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; Another great way to overcome writer’s block is to try writing exercises or prompts. Writing exercises are a great way to get your creative juices flowing and can help you break through writer’s block. There are many different writing exercises to choose from, such as freewriting, writing a story in a different genre, or even writing about a specific topic for a set amount of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstorm:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re having trouble coming up with ideas, try brainstorming. Jot down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. You might be surprised by what comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freewrite:&lt;/strong&gt; Writing can be daunting when you’re stuck, but freewriting can help you break through the block. Set a timer for a few minutes and just start writing. Don’t worry about the quality of your writing—just keep writing and don’t stop. You may find that some of the ideas that come out of it are actually pretty good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read:&lt;/strong&gt; It can also be helpful to read other writers’ work to get inspired. Reading other writers’ work can help you get ideas and provide valuable insights into the craft of writing. You can also join a writing group or workshop. This is a great way to get feedback on your work and get motivated to keep writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-care:&lt;/strong&gt; Finally, it is important to make sure that you are taking care of yourself. Make sure that you are getting enough rest, eating healthy, and exercising regularly. Taking care of your body and your mind can help you feel energised and motivated to write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writer’s block can be a daunting obstacle to overcome. However, with the right strategies and techniques, you can get back to writing with enthusiasm and creativity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-writing&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Writing!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>01 Jan 2023</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/01/How-to-Overcome-Writers-Block/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2023/01/01/How-to-Overcome-Writers-Block/</guid> </item> <item> <title>360 Degree: Excel at Anything and Everything by Dr Swati Lodha</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are you a ‘complete hero’ or wish to work towards becoming one?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you want to enhance your complete personality and achieve wholesomeness?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you wish to live a life where your success and satisfaction level matches all the potential in you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, do you want to excel at anything and everything?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of SPYCE—Sum of Person, Professional, Partner, Parent and Perennial in You to Create Excellence.

His eventful boyhood in Lhasa, thrilling escape to India and subsequent exile in Dharamsala, captured the imagination of thousands. With an endearing smile and childish humor, he has become a symbol of optimism and hope for the oppressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tracing his life through 100 lesser-known and inspiring incidents, unusual trivia, and gorgeous illustrations, this one-of-a-kind book explores the Dalai Lama’s vision, teachings, and philosophies. His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 100 Anecdotes is a classic tribute and a collectible edition that celebrates the various facets of an extraordinary spiritual leader from his birth through his eighty-seventh birthday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have always heard about His Holiness the Dalai Lama, but how much do we know about him?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 100 Anecdotes” is a truly remarkable collection of unknown incidents and trivia that takes the reader through his journey right from his childhood to this date. Each one-page anecdote is short, concise, and easy to read. The anecdotes provide a wonderful introduction to the Dalai Lama and his life and experiences. Most of the stories are really touching and entertaining. They are presented in a very engaging manner, which makes the reader want to read more and more. This book is a must-read for all those who want to know about him, his life, and his philosophies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I loved about this book is that it talks about some of the lesser-known events of his life, which is pretty interesting. I have learned so many interesting facts about the Dalai Lama and his journey. Like how he was chosen to become the 14th Dalai Lama, that he has been living in India since 1956, and of course, about the pictusque locations of Tibet and India that he visited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book has given me a new perspective on the life of the Dalai Lama. It is an easy and fun read, which will leave you inspired. Each page is an inspiring anecdote that you can relate to, especially in your own journeys. Whether it’s about following your interests or passion, staying calm in testing as well as happy times, or dealing with troubles. The book has given me a new way of looking at my own life and given me insights for becoming a better person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book also contains beautiful illustrations. And the burgundy red colour of the book, which is the color worn by the Buddhist monks, make the book visually appealing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend reading this book!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Aug 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/08/26/His-Holiness-the-Dalai-Lama-in-100-Anecdotes/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/08/26/His-Holiness-the-Dalai-Lama-in-100-Anecdotes/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Sinbad and the Tomb of Alexander by Kevin Missal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;EVIL ALWAYS FINDS ANOTHER WAY&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You would think having saved the world from Armageddon would have its perks, but sadly there are no happily ever afters. Because evil never sleeps. We battled the Angel of Death and prevented the trumpet of Israfil from being blown. But Iblis, the Devil King, is after yet another artefact that can bring him back to life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now my crew and I race against time to find the famed Water of Life. And as luck would have it, it is said to be hidden in the legendary tomb of-wait for it-Alexander the Great. What fate!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So here I am again, Sinbad the Sailor, pitted against Viking warriors, immortal Chinese alchemists, haunted isles and murderous golems, creatures of the dark . . . you get the drift. Then there is the Lame Archdemon, Admiral Sakhr, a foe far more sinister than I have ever encountered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And on top of it all, my friends seem to be drifting away from me, as is the love of my life, Safeena, Iblis’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Kevin Missal’s second book in the Sinbad series is a thrilling reimagination of the fabled sailor from the classic One Thousand and One Nights!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Kevin Missal’s 2nd book in the Sinbad Series, Sinbad the sailor is on his journey to reach the tomb of Alexander to find the Water of Life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader gets to join on his journey as he fights dragons, gholems, Viking warriors, and immortal Chinese alchemists with the help of his friends—witch, vampires and other pirates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the cover art and interior illustrations throughout the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was my first time reading Kevin Missal’s work and I was pretty excited to read Sinbad’s story. And this story does offer great adventure. The reader gets to travel to mystical lands with a group of people having their own set of magical powers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The readers can hear the clang of swords, see the sparkle of magic, and feel the claustrophobia of being attacked by squids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing is style is simple and almost modern instead of being the expected vintage and fantasy-type language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is an ode to love, friendship, trust, and duty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hadn’t read the 1st book in the series. Being a different adventure, it can be read as a standalone. However, just like any fantasy genre, there is character development and background stories that only take place over the course of the series. And to understand that, the series need to be read as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Directly reading part 2, I felt a lack of character building for most of the characters and why Sinbad felt so connected to his unlikely group of friends. I could only presume that it was covered in part 1, but little connections to part one would have been helpful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert I also felt that the author has not been able to accomplish any goals he set at the beginning of this book. The book is only a journey, which reaches no solid destination by the end. Therefore, enforcing the point that the story needs to be read in series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am excited to read more books in the series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Aug 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/08/06/Sinbad-and-the-Tomb-of-Alexander-by-Kevin-Missal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/08/06/Sinbad-and-the-Tomb-of-Alexander-by-Kevin-Missal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Ruskin Bond's Boyhood Memoir Series</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking for the Rainbow: My Years With Daddy&lt;/strong&gt; At age eight, Ruskin escapes his jail-like boarding school in the hills and goes to live with his father in Delhi. His time in the capital is filled with books, visits to the cinema, music and walks and conversations with his father—a dream life for a curious and wildly imaginative boy, which turns tragic all too soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, Ruskin Bond has regaled and mesmerized readers with his tales. In Looking for the Rainbow, Bond travels to his own past, recalling his favourite adventures (and misadventures) with extraordinary charm, splotches of wit, a pinch of poignance and not a trace of bitterness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What you’re holding, dear reader, is a classic in the making.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Till the Clouds Roll By: Beginning Again&lt;/strong&gt; A couple of years after his father’s death, ten-year-old Ruskin travels to Dehradun to spend his holidays with his new family. As he reacquaints himself with his mother, now remarried and with a busy social life, his stepfather and new siblings, a pensive Ruskin longs for his father’s company, his stamp collection and the old gramophone. Trying to escape this unfamiliar place, he immerses himself in books and explores the forest glades, canals and bazaars of the little town, forming some unlikely friendships on the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the much-loved Looking for the Rainbow, the master storyteller lends another backward glance at his boyhood years-a vacation that took place over seventy winters ago-remembering his days with rare humour, remarkable charm and twinges of heartache.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming Round the Mountain: In the Year of Independence&lt;/strong&gt; ‘It was 1947, and life was about to change quite dramatically for most of us’ Thirteen-year-old Ruskin is back at school, doing what he loves-reading, goal-keeping, spending time with his friends and eating lots of jalebis. But things seem to be rapidly changing all around him. Whispers of a partition haunt the corridors of his school. Does the formation of a new, independent India mean saying goodbye to old friends-and, with it, the shenanigans they got up to?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the heels of Looking for the Rainbow and Till the Clouds Roll By, Coming Round the Mountain is yet another look at the past, in particular one memorable year, 1947, during which a lot happened to Ruskin and those around him. It is a fitting finale to a journey down memory lane, one about accepting change and finding hope in the unknown days to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Song of India: The year I went away&lt;/strong&gt; Sixteen-year-old Ruskin, after having finally finished his school, is living with his stepfather and mother at the Old Station Canteen in Dehradun. Struggling to begin his writing journey, he tries to make a passage to England to chase his true calling. But as he prepares for his long voyage, the prospect of saying goodbye to the warm, sunny shores of India looms large.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brought straight from his past, Ruskin Bond recalls the longing for familiarity, the joys of receiving his first money order, publishing his stories and finding new friends. Following the trail of Looking for the Rainbow, Till the Clouds Roll By and Coming Round the Mountain, A Song of India is another year from the life of a fiery teenager as he embarks on a journey to an unfamiliar land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to Your Heart: The London Adventure&lt;/strong&gt; ‘I followed my heart instead of my head. It is something I have done all my life.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly before his eighteenth birthday, Ruskin embarks on a literary journey and reaches England after charting unknown waters. Greeted by the uncertainties of a new city, he muses over his loneliness, switches jobs, falls in love, befriends the ocean and relentlessly chases a big dream! What follows next is the metamorphosis of a journal entry into a novel as we time-travel to the fascinating events that led to the making of his iconic book, The Room on the Roof.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capturing memorable experiences from young Ruskin’s life, Listen to Your Heart is an inspiration for aspiring young writers, a meditation on embracing fears, seizing every opportunity but most importantly living one’s dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruskin Bond is one of the greatest children’s book writers of all time. His writing style is simple and quick to relate to, no matter where you are from. Ruskin’s Boyhood Memoir Series is an account of his life from age 8 to 18. I am going to share the review of the entire series of five books here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The series takes place in Delhi, Dehradun and England, and is based on Ruskin’s real-life experiences growing up, covering his development from a young boy into a young man. Each book, of around a hundred pages, is just an hour-long read with beautiful illustrations every few pages. The series portrays Indian life and culture with Ruskin’s evocative and lyrical writing style.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The series is a delightful read, full of Ruskin’s trademark wit and humour and is full of great bookish recommendations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first book &lt;em&gt;“Looking for the Rainbow: My Years With Daddy”&lt;/em&gt; the reader gets introduced to Ruskin’s early life and family situation. His love for his father is visible and almost tangible. We are taken around Delhi. It is the place I have lived for 21 years. And it is the place he talks about with an experience from 70 years ago. And, it still feels the same. We get to know about Ruskin’s father’s death, which is emotional but not too dramatic. The writing style is comforting and the book ends with a hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the second book &lt;em&gt;“Till the Clouds Roll By: Beginning Again”&lt;/em&gt;, Ruskin Bond spends his vacation with his mother and stepfather. We see Ruskin’s adventurous side and his growing love for reading. The reader gets to know where Ruskin’s love for reading/written word comes from. The gradual attempt of an introvert to find an escape from the boring reality and unexpected friendships comforts Ruskin as he deals with the loss of his father. It is another warm story that would motivate its readers to deal with their own personal tragedies and find positivity in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third book &lt;em&gt;“Coming Round the Mountain: In the Year of Independence”&lt;/em&gt; takes place around the year of Independence. We see Ruskin Bond, being a typical teenager, who loves goofing around with his friends. And, later we also see him dealing with the loss of his friends who had to leave. Ruskin very eloquently provides a teenager’s perspective about the struggles people faced during the partition in a very sad yet optimistic manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the fourth book &lt;em&gt;“A Song of India: The year I went away”&lt;/em&gt;, Ruskin Bond has identified his love for writing. The freedom of getting a space of his own, and being able to write uninterrupted, plays a big role in his writing journey, giving the readers hope that the tiniest wins of life can actually lead them to bigger achievements. However, like many of us, he struggles to get recognition for his talent. He faces rejection and critique, but nothing makes him lose hope. He knows he wants to become a writer, and he takes all the necessary steps to get closer to his goal. One of those steps being to leave India&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the final book &lt;em&gt;“Listen to Your Heart: The London Adventure”&lt;/em&gt;, he reaches London, which proves to be a difficult transition. Struggling to make both ends meet, he works hard, while writing passionately. After being rejected by multiple publishers, his manuscript is finally picked by an editor who wants to take a chance on him, provided he makes some changes, and also gives him an advance cheque. Ruskin’s love for India finally takes over, and he returns to India to continue writing in the warmth and familiarity of the country. As an Indian, my love for my country grows as Ruskin presents it to me with a fresher yet yesteryear’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though these books can be read as standalone, I got the opportunity to read all 5 books in a go, and they couldn’t have been read in a better manner. It is an overall wholesome comforting experience reading about one of my favourite authors’ childhood, struggles, and early journey towards becoming India’s best author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 Jul 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/07/19/Ruskin-Bond-Boyhood-Memoir/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/07/19/Ruskin-Bond-Boyhood-Memoir/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Wheel of Fortune</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A troubled girl is now finding herself bridging the past again.

The writing style is very subtle, which does complete justice to this novella. I just loved the Book Cover, isn’t it attractive? I really liked how without any drama and exaggeration the story concludes. That is due to the author’s sheer writing skills.” - &lt;em&gt;Sakshi Nair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - “I liked the story as it was fresh and something unique. The story also gave a message about our thoughts how it impacts our way of life.” - &lt;em&gt;Meraj&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - “This is so perfect for my small attention span😭 perfect. 💗” - &lt;em&gt;Amazon Customer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐ - “I read it at 2am and can’t leave untill i complete it. I love this short story. And the ending was very good and impressive and 100% true. I am agree with the author what she is trying to tell us. Don’t try to find short cuts in ur life work hard and u can achieve anything. Your body respond to what your brain want it to do. So think positive and results will be positive. “ - &lt;em&gt;Habiba Khalid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐ - “I liked the way author kept it simple and intresting. As I said it’s a short story so if i start telling you about it more i might end up giving the exact information, and i am pretty sure that’s not what my wheel of fortune predicted today.” - &lt;em&gt;Rashmi Shetty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>14 Jul 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/07/14/The-Wheel-of-Fortune/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/07/14/The-Wheel-of-Fortune/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unique, magical, unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I have to be short and direct with my review, this is it. If you happen to meet me or text me and ask how I found “The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern”, that is all you are gonna hear from me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is unless you are ready to have a real conversation. You know, 3 am conversations. About life and the universe and whether mushrooms are drugs kind of conversations. That is the kind of conversation needed if you really want to talk about this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that you have decided to continue reading this review, let me give a brief of how I really feel about this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you believe in magic? You must have seen many magic tricks in life. But I am talking about real magic. The kind we see in fairy tales with magic wands. Most of us don’t believe in that sort of magic. We are believers of science and facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author writes, “They [People] want to believe that magic is nothing but clever deception, because to think it real would keep them up at night, afraid of their own existence.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, that’s true. Like, really, imagine a world where you could fix broken things with just a look, turn things into something else, change your clothes like your mood, fix your injuries with a touch, and travel to places without moving an inch. Won’t it be horrifyingly amazing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, sadly, we boring mortal humans don’t know how to do magic, but we do have the Night Circus – a place where you can experience it all firsthand. All the horrifyingly amazing things I mentioned, you get to witness. Reading this book is like being at the Night Circus. So, it does make come true one of the many magical experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author provides an almost real experience with the magical description of Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams). There are many tents in the circus, each providing a different experience to the visitor/reader. I like how the author chooses to tell the reader about each tent separately throughout the book and not mix it with the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is almost poetic and definitely dreamy. The story takes unpredictable turns one after the other and keeps you wondering about what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each character is given a frame, a space of their own. The reader is really able to bond with the characters. I particularly like Celia and Marco’s relationship as it grows through the story. It is an amazing, tragic, and forever kind of love story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend you read it if you like fantasy, magic, and romance that is not cliché.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 Jun 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/19/The-Night-Circus-by-Erin-Morgenstern/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/19/The-Night-Circus-by-Erin-Morgenstern/</guid> </item> <item> <title> Paati vs UNCLE by Meera Ganapathi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All Inju wants is a quiet, boring holiday at the most boring house in Mumbai, but life at Parijat Retirement Colony is not the same any more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A thief is on the loose, and Paati has decided to become an UNCLE! But when the uncles of UNCLE (The Underground Nightly Cooperative League of Elders) act not so cooperative, Inju takes charge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joining forces with a lady whose papads were stolen, the skinny building watchman and Paati, Inju forms PAATI (The People’s Association against Thieves International).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can this motley crew of detectives crack the code?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Paati vs. UNCLE” reminded me of the many Enid Blyton novels I used to read as a kid. What not was there to keep a child occupied during summer vacations? Kids on vacation, no homework or studies, and a mystery to solve. The only difference being that in “Paati vs. UNCLE” it is not a team of kids, but an unlikely pair of a grandma and grandson on their quest to find a thief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paati, like almost every grandmother, dotes on her grandson, feeding him delicious food and providing him a perfectly safe and boring vacation. Inju, like every grandson, is the one who would introduce his grandmother to innovative ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cute dadi-pota jodi (grandma-grandson duo) is so relatable, so real. I, for sure, felt a very strong connection with Paati. Grandma who takes care of her Tupperware like gold and silver; who has a locked closet that contains all the antiquities and photographs from ages ago; who makes banana chips and cute animal-shaped dosas. That’s my Nani!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These characters and their personalities are as real, as honest, as close to heart as they could get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about the themes of the story, the author very smartly and subtly touches on the topic of existing sexism in society, using the terms “UNCLE” (a club of old men – The Underground Nightly Cooperative League of Elders) and “Aunty” (Captain Aunty – a doctor turned freedom fighter) as more than just the terms by making it a metaphor of bully and courage respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main plot revolves around the lonely lives of senior citizens. To what extent they can go to make their lives a little more entertaining, a little more not-mundane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Special mention to Parmita Mukherjee for the gorgeous illustrations!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed every bit of this book and highly recommend it. Whether you are a kid, adult, or senior citizen, this book is an enjoyable read for readers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Jun 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/16/Paati-vs-UNCLE-by-Meera-Ganapathi/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/16/Paati-vs-UNCLE-by-Meera-Ganapathi/</guid> </item> <item> <title>House Boy by Lorenzo DeStefano</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;House Boy is a contemporary thriller set in Southern India and in the polite suburb of Hendon, North London. At 321 Finchley Lane, ancient traditions take root and prosper in our so-called civilized society. The lives of a boy from rural India, Vijay Pallan, and an Indo-British woman and her son, Binda and Ravi Tagorstani, collide as if decreed by history. Through Vijay, we experience the shocking realities of modern slavery, the human spirit’s boundless capacity for pain, and the ultimate blessing of one young man’s redemption and survival.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lorenzo DeStefano’s House Boy is a painfully realistic page-turner that is both enthralling and horrifying. The book discusses the persistent caste discrimination and human slavery in India and never lets you forget them through the author’s haunting storytelling. As an Indian, as much as I hate to accept the lengths to which such crimes take place, I can’t turn a blind eye to the ground realities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are as human as they can be - complex and deeply motivated. In terms of world-building, DeStefano is consistently amazing. From Chettipattu to Chennai to London, he takes the readers not only into the character’s journey but also into the settings where it happens. Despite the harsh realities that it tackles, House Boy gives vivid imagery of the towns and cities involved in Vijay’s travels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are very well-rounded, and each character gives justice to its part. I love the efforts the author has put into creating an authentic Indian culture, and the caste bias is shown in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I must say, it has been an amazing rollercoaster ride of emotions-thrilling, scary, sad, and hopeful by the end. I was definitely not expecting the flood of emotions in the second half of the book, but it was a welcome retreat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is a scary yet brutally honest display of the crimes in the name of caste and slavery. Filled with anger against social issues, this book is a gut-wrenching read. A great read that will ground you and make you check your privilege.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Jun 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/08/House-Boy-by-Lorenzo-DeStefano/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/06/08/House-Boy-by-Lorenzo-DeStefano/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Midnight Library by Matt Haig</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe, there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life.

Would any of these other lives truly be better?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In The Midnight Library, Matt Haig’s enchanting novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one—following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist—she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After Nora Seed attempts suicide, she reaches a place between life and death—the midnight library. The time stops at midnight as she meets Mrs. Elms, who guides her through the workings of the library.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has weaved around the plot of multiple lives and parallel universes and is able to present it beautifully. All the lives though vastly different from each other, feels connected at some level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have wanted to read Matt Haig’s work for a long time, and I am glad that I picked up this particular book. The writing style is very appealing. The story is almost dreamy, and I wished it could have gone on for a while more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have read about Akashic Records, a term well known to those who meditate, and feel that the author has knowingly or unknowingly talked about the same. “The Akashic records are a compendium of all universal events, thoughts, words, emotions and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future in terms of all entities and life forms, not just human. They are believed by theosophists to be encoded in a non-physical plane of existence known as the mental plane.” – Wikipedia&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Midnight Library offers a twist to the concept of Akashic Records by sticking to the current life and providing infinite possibilities of what else could one’s life had been if the person had made a slightly different choice at any stage of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A reader might expect the book to be a guide for depressed people and people with suicidal thoughts. But that’s not true. The role of this book is to provide you with a perspective of your own life. It is not a commentary on mental health. The book is a work of fiction and plays with the idea of “What could have been?” more than “What is?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend reading this book if you are looking for a light unique read, which goes beyond scope of your usual genres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 May 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/30/The-Midnight-Library-by-Matt-Haig/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/30/The-Midnight-Library-by-Matt-Haig/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Becoming by Michelle Obama</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;An intimate, powerful, and inspiring memoir by the former First Lady of the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a life filled with meaning and accomplishment, Michelle Obama has emerged as one of the most iconic and compelling women of our era. As First Lady of the United States of America—the first African-American to serve in that role—she helped create the most welcoming and inclusive White House in history, while also establishing herself as a powerful advocate for women and girls in the U.S. and around the world, dramatically changing the ways that families pursue healthier and more active lives, and standing with her husband as he led America through some of its most harrowing moments. Along the way, she showed us a few dance moves, crushed Carpool Karaoke, and raised two down-to-earth daughters under an unforgiving media glare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her memoir, a work of deep reflection and mesmerizing storytelling, Michelle Obama invites readers into her world, chronicling the experiences that have shaped her—from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago to her years as an executive balancing the demands of motherhood and work, to her time spent at the world’s most famous address. With unerring honesty and lively wit, she describes her triumphs and her disappointments, both public and private, telling her full story as she has lived it—in her own words and on her own terms. Warm, wise, and revelatory, Becoming is the deeply personal reckoning of a woman of soul and substance who has steadily defied expectations—and whose story inspires us to do the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Becoming is the life of Michelle Obama as she transcends from one phase of her life to another, on a journey to becoming her better self. As a daughter, a sister, a lawyer, a wife, a mother, and the first African-American First Lady, she witnesses diverse experiences and juggles multiple responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michelle Obama openly speaks about being a part of the minority. Being black and a woman is often a reason enough to be oppressed. However, Michelle Obama is never distracted from her focus to do good for others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She takes you on the journey of her life and makes you the direct witness of the insider story. She talks about her childhood, her work-life as a lawyer, meeting and falling in love with Barrack Obama, and finally adjusting and making the best use of her life at the White House. She doesn’t shy away from making some brutally honest remarks about fellow politicians and their spouses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latter half of the book, we get to witness the life of Barrack Obama as well. ‘Becoming’ paints the picture of Michelle and Barrack Obama in bright white light, of Barrack more than Michelle. It hardly ever feels that the two can ever do anything wrong (in a political sense), even if it’s a mistake. The worst of the two we can see is only in their personal lives, with regards to judgments about each other and Barrack’s lack of availability for the family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are also introduced to Michelle Obama’s daughters, friends, family members, and colleagues who support her and Barrack Obama unconditionally, being there through the thicks and thins of their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is more of a factual description than an emotional conversation. All the moments—happy or sad, exciting or angry—are presented matter-of-factly, staying away from any kind of drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved how the book flowed from one moment of her life to another. Each scene weaves together neatly forming this beautiful story, which is Michelle’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I listened to the 19 hours of the audiobook (narrated by Michelle Obama herself) over a few weeks of my morning walks. And I am glad I decided to pick the audiobook instead of a physical copy. I am sure I would have left this book a few chapters into it. Not that this book is particularly boring, but being a memoir you don’t expect it to hook you. There is no incentive to keep going other than the fact that you want to read it. So, the audiobook seemed like the perfect reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend you to read this 400+ pages book only if US politics or memoirs of popular people interest you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 May 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/19/Becoming-by-Michelle-Obama/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/19/Becoming-by-Michelle-Obama/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ’80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story near its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahh! Where do I start talking about this book? Intense, dramatic, scandalous are just some of the many things that make up this book’s plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story’s protagonist is Monique Grant, a journalist, who has been asked to interview Evelyn Hugo by Evelyn herself. A major proportion of the story, however, is from the perspective of Evelyn and takes place in flashbacks. Evelyn retraces her journey from when she was 14 years old and married a guy to escape from her abusive father; to her struggle to get into Hollywood; to her desire for both fame and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as you hear the title, you immediately judge Evelyn Hugo for having the tag of Seven Husbands. You try to reason or decode the story, but that is far from what the author has planned to present to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evelyn Hugo at first appears to be wrong and selfish. But then by saying, “Don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box,” she shuts the reader up. You are bound to stop judging her and listen to her story with an open mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The power of the story lies in its exceptional storytelling, its hard-hitting dialogues, and its complex human behaviour. Humans are not meant to fit into a box. We are not that simple. Our mind and our heart are complex things and that is what the author beautifully brings up in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You must have, at some point, found yourselves wondering: what does love mean? Is it intimacy, loyalty, or trust? Well, whatever it means, this book will certainly change your perception of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the story progresses, you realize that it is not about the husbands. It is not about multiple marriages. It is not even about Evelyn Hugo. This story is just an ode to love and friendship. It challenges your idea of marriage and divorce, romance and intimacy, power and fame, death and loss, regret and guilt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, the underlying question is: What would you do if were to choose between your love or fame? At any point, would you regret your decision to choose one thing over the other?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you like romance, hollywood, drama, emotional, historical fiction, women’s fiction, or lgbtq+ fiction, this book is a must read for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 May 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/11/the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo-by-taylor-jenkins-reid/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/05/11/the-seven-husbands-of-evelyn-hugo-by-taylor-jenkins-reid/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Laser Eye Warrior: Legacy of Rudra by Dhyanesh</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A celestial warrior prince, Given the unmatched power of Laser. Rudra, the prince of an interplanetary kingdom is set to get a throne he doesn’t want. His destiny―to become the destroyer of evil and the saviour of good. An obstacle stands in his way, his rage. His gift of the third eye―the laser eye―is a sophisticated and destructive weapon that needs to be harnessed. The Asuras have come up with the leverage that could destroy the universe―mindless clone warriors. A higher power instructs Rudra to stop it. Will he be able to control his anger and save the universe using his powerful weapon? Does he rule the universe in the end? Dive into the stellar world of Rudra and explore the stars like never before…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indian mythology is taking over the hearts of readers lately. I find so many books in the market about Ram, Raavan, Sita, Draupadi, Krishna, etc., that I have lost the count. But the Hindu god that garners the most attention is Shiva.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wikipedia: Shiva is one of the 3 principal deities of Hinduism. Shiva is said to be the controller of time itself and has the responsibility of carrying out the process of destruction at the end of creation. One of his 108 names is Rudra. Rudra is a Rigvedic deity associated with wind or storm, Vayu, and the hunt. One translation of the name is ‘the roarer’. In the Rigveda, Rudra is praised as the ‘mightiest of the mighty’. Rudra means ‘who eradicates problems from their roots’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dhyanesh, the 15-year-old author of the book, has made an excellent attempt at presenting the story of Rudra. Rudra is a celestial warrior prince, born with a gift—HIS THIRD EYE. When Rudra is in rage, his third eye opens up, destroying anyone in his way. The gift, therefore, becomes a threat to him and his loved ones as Rudra is innately an aggressive person. How Rudra learns to use his gift and fights against Asuras is the plot of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We see a beautiful love story of Rudra and his lover and the warrior princess—Parvati, who helps him in the fight against Asuras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author doesn’t put much effort into modernizing the story. It is mythology and promisingly stays so. The world of mythology is turned, twisted, and manipulated to bring to life this piece of fiction, but never is the focus misplaced from the mythology we know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I love about the book is the simplicity of the writing and the complexity of the plot weaved together neatly to create a book that really hooks the reader. Dhyanesh definitely gives tough competition to other Indian mythology writers like Amish Tripathi, Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, and Devdutt Pattanaik.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many characters in the story (Nandi, Brahma, Indra, Saraswati, Ganga, etc.), and I had to create a character map to deal with them. Even though I know all these characters, it is not easy to remember the kingdoms they belong to and their relationships with other characters in the story. The author has provided the cast of characters in the beginning, which the reader can refer to when confused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are a fan of Indian mythology or are interested to read about it or have gotten bored of the existing popular Indian mythology writers, this book is a must-try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Apr 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/04/12/The-Laser-Eye-Warrior-by-Dhyanesh/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/04/12/The-Laser-Eye-Warrior-by-Dhyanesh/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Verses of this Universe by Ashok Subramanian and Shweta Hitesh Joshi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘Verses of this Universe – Poetarrati Volume 3’ is a collection of contemporary poems written by Shweta Hitesh Joshi and Ashok Subramanian. 61 poems, compiled under five headings, explore, celebrate and question the human inside – the head and the heart, and outside – the society, humanity and nature. A unique experiment of ‘Picture poetry’ called the ‘Ekphrasis Journey’ brings out the collaboration between the poet and artists Sridhar, Divya and Anirudh. The book has been carefully edited by Thailambal Satheesh, an English scholar, teacher and editor. Most poems are written in the ‘free verse’ style. The contrasting styles and substance of the poets indulge the reader on a journey of myriad emotions, while at the same time, appeals to the heart and the mind with the questions of these times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As soon as I picked this book in my hand, the first question that came into my mind was “Why the landscape orientation of the book?” I have read books of multiple shapes and sizes, so the question was not brought up from the point of something being different from the normal. I just thought it would be inconvenient to handle and read poetry from a book of that dimension. It is almost double in width compared to a normal book. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, as I started reading, I understood the relevance of the orientation of the book. It allowed a full-size display of the image corresponding to each poetry. This is particularly important for Part 4: An Ekphrasis Journey, which is a picture poetry section. So, as I got the hang of the book, I started enjoying the reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poetries are written by Shweta Hitesh Joshi and Ashok Subramanian. Both the poets bring in a unique style of writing. While one mostly writes rhythmic poems the other specializes in free verses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poets stick to the title “Verses of this Universe” and provide a new lens to the reader to view the world with. From rains and rainbows to prey and predators; from a weak sapling surrounded by trees in a forest, to the last piece of green land in a concrete jungle; the two poets present to us nature with the help of contrasts. They take the usual, obvious stuff and present it in a way to make the reader notice it, appreciate it. They deal with not just nature, but humans and human emotions too. Everything that conspires the universe, makes this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 5 parts. 1: Deep inside the Human This part deals with the complex emotions of humans. The human mind and heart, happiness and pain, hope and death, and finding oneself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of my favourite verses is one by Shweta Hitesh Joshi: A hope that life would smile back, how, and when is not known yet… Till then, let me sleep and I know tomorrow will be better again… This verse make me smile and look for hope in my struggling times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2: Matters of the Heart It deals with the matters of love, romance and heartbreaks. The reader can’t help but think of their special someone who they can’t ignore, their smiles and laughs, the place where they sit in the park, and the way they talk about their favourite books. Ashok and Shweta add to the poetries the sincere wait of one-sided love, the butterflies of first love, and the torment of losing one’s lover/friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ashok Subramnian writes: I tried to imprint my love In her mind, Like writing on the beach sand. Every time she wavered, A wave washed away my message.   3: Conversations with the Universe A take of the poets on travel, humanity, time, pandemic, expressions of art, the world, nature and almost everything you witness in your life and nature. Things and ideas that are visible to the naked eyes but often not paid attention to find their place in this section of the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘Bits of Us’ is a poem by Ashok Subramnaian that I absolutely loved. It captures the essence of the universe so subtly yet so powerfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4: Art Meets Art: An Ekphrasis Journey Art meets Art, here, signifies the combination of visual and verbal art. Paintings and photographs are used as a prompt for the poetry. All the poems in this section are the contribution of Ashok Subramanian. My favourite is ‘Clocks and Deadlines’. Extremely relevant to corporate employees and students alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5: In the Lap of Nature This final part deals with the sun the moon, the stars, the rains, the trees. The beauty of nature, the sunny, rainy, cold, and starry world makes way into this part of the book. The reader genuinely feels like laying their head in the lap of nature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book effortlessly deals with various topics and emotions. It is easy to find something you are in the mood of reading. If you are a fan of poetry, this book is a great choice. However, its unorthodox shape makes it a little difficult to store in a normal bookshelf setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Apr 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/04/08/Verses-of-this-Universe-by-Ashok-and-Shweta/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/04/08/Verses-of-this-Universe-by-Ashok-and-Shweta/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Atomic Habits by James Clear</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter your goals, Atomic Habits offers a proven framework for improving–every day. James Clear, one of the world’s leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you’ll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learn how to: • make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy); • overcome a lack of motivation and willpower; • design your environment to make success easier; • get back on track when you fall off course; …and much more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits–whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We always want to build new habits. Learn a language, start eating healthy, start working out, maintain a journal, read a book, cook more, dance more, sing more, etc. Every new year starts with new hope, with a new resolution, but ends in the disappointment of not being able to stick with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like most people in the world, I made a resolution this year. It’s to ‘walk more’. Covid has made me super lazy and a couch potato. So I decided to go out and walk for at least 30 minutes every day. But walking without a purpose seemed lame to me. I immediately knew what would help. I downloaded ‘Audible’ and started searching for an interesting title. I found ‘Atomic Habits’, and with my 1 free credit, I downloaded it at once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grabbed my earphones, put on my shoes and went out for a walk. It felt super comfortable and even enjoyable. It’s just been 22 days till now and it’s going pretty well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘Atomic Habits’ is a guide to help you break bad behaviours and adopt good ones. It seemed to be a perfect partner to motivate me to continue the good habit that I wanted to inculcate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Clear, in a very simple format, shares many tips and tricks to help you start as well as continue doing good habits and, on the other hand, drop bad ones. The repetition of some concepts and emphasis with the help of examples helped me catch on if I ever lost track.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tips are simple and immediately implementable. Doesn’t matter what kind of habit it is, you can easily make it a part of your life if you implement even a few of the suggestions provided by the author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the first non-fiction audiobook I have ever tried. And, I think I am going to stick with audiobooks for the entire non-fiction genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the suggestions provided in the book, I had already been doing and many I learned as I listened to the audiobook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some awesome lessons that I have applied:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stack 2 habits together—What you NEED to do and what you WANT to do: I needed to walk, and I wanted to read a book. Now, I am doing both of them together; thanks to audiobooks. It has become a sort of motivation for me to walk. If I walk, then only I get to listen to an audiobook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make a habit tracker: I had already been using one for the past 9-10 months. But, I got inconsistent with it recently, and now I am continuing it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;1% improvement every day: When I started my morning walk 16 days ago, I could just do 2500 steps in 30 minutes. Now I am doing 5000 steps in 50 minutes. And I plan to keep increasing it a little every day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having an accountability partner: I did a writing challenge a few months ago with a group of 3 other ladies. I was able to finish the challenge by writing 500 words a day for 15 days, finishing a short story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the help of this book, I learned the process of creating new habits. As James Clear writes, “Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: How can I make it obvious? How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?” A simple formula, that can help you in building any kind of habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, in a nutshell, if you were to read just one book in your lifetime, make sure you read this one, and then make a habit of reading more. * wink *&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jan 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/29/Atomic-Habits-by-James-Clear/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/29/Atomic-Habits-by-James-Clear/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Sita's Kitchen by Raghav Khanna</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was told, ‘Girls belong in the kitchen’, but her destiny was to rule it as a chef.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;London-based restaurateur Arun and his assistant Ben are on a business trip. They stop at a roadside café in Himachal Pradesh and are astonished with its European looks and Italian menu. A cynical Arun samples a dish and is blown away by its authenticity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His astonishment turns into disbelief when he learns that the cook is Sita, a simple mountain girl who has never in her life stepped outside her village. Ever since her mother passed away, Sita started helping her deaf-mute father run their small tea stall. Sita loves cooking and when a travelling Italian chef gifts her a cookbook, the passion becomes an obsession. Aided by YouTube videos, Sita soon revamps the tea stall and turns it into an elfin café.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arun recognizes Sita’s extraordinary talents and convinces her to move to London and become a chef at his restaurant. However, Sita’s lack of professional training is soon apparent. Help comes in the form of Anwar Khan, a veteran butcher, who takes a floundering Sita under his wings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She embarks on a journey, navigating the cut-throat and often ugly world of gourmet chefs where gender conventions and racial undercurrents can make or break careers. As she strives to carve a niche for herself, Arun starts feeling differently towards Sita.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just when Sita starts believing in her special destiny, one incident alters her inside out and leads her to rediscovering herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;‘Sita’s Kitchen’ is a very well-crafted and subtle, feel-good story. The reader is introduced to Sita’s journey and her struggles from being a ten-year-old girl losing her mother, to renovating her deaf-dumb father’s tapri shop into a European style café to learning to make Italian cuisine with the help of YouTube, to reaching and fighting for her place in a top restaurant in London.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has a good knowledge of food and its ingredients, which can be seen in the work. He is able to make you fall in love with the art of creating food. The scenic view of Himachal Pradesh and later the charm of London is aptly captured. Even on the cover, one can see the beautiful hills of Himachal in one window and the London Eye and the Big Ben on the other window, as Sita plates a beautiful Italian dish, perfectly providing a gist of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story progresses from two narrator’s perspectives—Sita and Arun’s assistant, Ben. Though Ben doesn’t provide any additional plot to the story, he presents Arun’s life from an assistant’s point of view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What I love about this book is how simply it deals with a physical disability, gay relationship, divorce, and women empowerment. These subplots are not enlarged beyond necessity and the focus is maintained on Sita and her passion for cooking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sky is the limit when you are working towards your passion—is the message you get from this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are a passionate person, particularly about food, this is a book for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PS: I found the blurb revealing and misleading to some extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>22 Jan 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/22/Sitas-Kitchen-by-Raghav-Khanna/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/22/Sitas-Kitchen-by-Raghav-Khanna/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Girl Gets Kidnapped by Sumit Pramanik</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A secret agent. A tow-faced-enemy. A race against time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vikram, one of the most influential personalities in India, kidnaps a girl to instigate a riot. Riju, an undercover agent of the Research and Analysis Wing, must rescue the girl to stop the bloodshed and save thousands of people. He jeopardizes the secrecy of his true identity as he hunts for the kidnapper. However, Vikram will not hesitate before putting his reputation and life on the line to succeed in his plans. As the riot spreads, claiming more souls with every passing minute, can Riju free the girl before it becomes too late?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author’s imagination runs amok the dark webs, which not every reader has the stomach to digest. Like his debut novel, Girl Behind the Glass, this book is written in a manner that is meant to cause discomfort to the readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Girl Gets Kidnapped” deals with the reality of the Hindu-Muslim relationship in India, but more than that, how the fragility of that relationship is misused by the people in power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story presents to the reader the dark side of politics and how no one matters to the politicians more than their wins and personal gains. The title and the cover could have been better to make the book more attractive. However, the story is well-written and well-crafted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has great ideas and an exceptional storytelling style. This piece of writing makes you squirm. It makes you hate the characters and sometimes the writer for writing them, but gradually you are able to relate it with real people and incidents. The fiction doesn’t remain fiction anymore and becomes the reality check of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story might gage controversy. However, this is the kind of book that should be the talk of the town. It has got everything from a relevant plot to bold and unapologetic storytelling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Jan 2022</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/09/Girl-Gets-Kidnapped-by-Sumit-Pramanik/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2022/01/09/Girl-Gets-Kidnapped-by-Sumit-Pramanik/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, to say that it all began when Sophie Mol came to Ayemenem is only one way of looking at it . . . It could be argued that it actually began thousands of years ago. Long before the Marxists came. Before the British took Malabar, before the Dutch Ascendancy, before Vasco da Gama arrived, before the Zamorin’s conquest of Calicut. Before Christianity arrived in a boat and seeped into Kerala like tea from a teabag. That it really began in the days when the Love Laws were made. The laws that lay down who should be loved, and how. And how much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The God of Small Things&lt;/em&gt; is a family drama shown from the perspective of fraternal twins, Estha and Rahel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is set in Ayemenem, Kerala, India and gives a clear and bold picture of the town in the year 1969 amid Communist protests. The caste discrimination and social boundaries are visible and tangible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story begins when thirty-one-year-old Rahel returns to her town to reunite with her twin for the first time since they last saw each other when they were 7. The story unfolds telling the readers what led to their separation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arundhati Roy presents a picture of a typical Indian joint family and the bittersweet relationship within the members. But most importantly romantic relationships that cross the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multiple themes are eloquently touched upon like Family, Caste Discrimination, Guilt, Blame, Innocence, Love, Fear, and Death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We learn through the story how the tragic incident of the death of Sophie Mol led to the separation of the twins and their mother, Ammu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What adds to the heart-wrenching drama is unpredictable human emotions and behaviour. One person, if acted differently than how they did, could have changed the course of action and saved the entire relay of events that followed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, things happened, characters died, and others suffered the loss of their loved ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much like life. No matter how well you know something is not right, you do it. Maybe for love or for your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story unfolds through two timelines. One in the present year, 1993, and the other where the life-changing events took place, 1969. The transitions between the two years are smooth and effortless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is a simple and innocent perspective of Estha and Rahel. We see the twins learning the harsh realities of life as they experience them first-hand one after the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this book if you would like to read about India or themes like forbidden love and tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Nov 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/11/25/The-God-of-Small-Things-by-Arundhati-Roy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/11/25/The-God-of-Small-Things-by-Arundhati-Roy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Beyond Earth and Sky by Mannat Gupta</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Earth and Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a poetry collection that talks about romance, love and the unending potential of the mind that perhaps never sees the dawn of light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With an attempt to galvanize hearts to feel something exquisite and indescribable like love, Beyond Earth and Sky might take you on a delightful journey and make you bow to nature, the sky, and earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those who wish to experience the divine within, have a hope of hope, find inner strength, and savor the ultimate expression of the heart, this book is written for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Earth and Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of poetries where each poetry is an attempt to reintroduce the reader to one of the millions of their emotions and feelings. With a very simple yet touching writing style, the writer is able to bring in front what a lot of us think about but don’t have the words to express.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A casual and laid-back approach has been followed in writing the poetries, which is why it also touches the reader’s soul in a simplistic manner. And yet it doesn’t fail to address the emotional complexity of the human mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond Earth and Sky is a dreamy journal of thoughts written by a magical pen. The poems will allow you to appreciate everything around you and within you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you enjoy lucid poetries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Nov 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/11/15/Beyond-Earth-and-Sky-by-Mannat-Gupta/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/11/15/Beyond-Earth-and-Sky-by-Mannat-Gupta/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Rich Dad Poor Dad” is Robert’s story of growing up with two dads — his real father and the father of his best friend, his “rich dad” — and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t read a lot of non-fiction books, but some authors just know how to make a topic fun to read. Robert Kiyosaki is one such author. Investing used to seem like a big deal to me earlier. It seemed like a scary topic. It’s not that I didn’t understand the maths behind it, but it was the lack of confidence in taking the first step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I realized what investment should be like; how should they make your accounts look like. It also helped me distinguish between actual assets and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rich buy assets. The poor only have expenses. The middle class buy liabilities they think are assets.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book hooked me from page one where the author explains what led him to write this book. His rich dad taught him things that I think everyone should teach their kids. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cycle of getting a job, working, and paying bills is repeated till one retires. What makes rich people different from the rest is the question. I love how simplistically the author explains that concept and the difference between thinking like rich people and thinking like poor people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks about the issues normal people keep talking about—the gap between rich and poor gap: rich getting richer and poor getting poorer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know that more taxes are paid by the middle class and poor than by the rich. But it’s not because the government wants to exploit only one segment of the society. The government would love to get as much money as possible in the form of taxes. The reason is that rich people know how to escape taxes legally and use more percentage of their disposable income to invest in their assets. They know how to get their money to work for them rather than them working for the government. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a lot to learn from this book. Not only do we understand investment strategies but the mindset of an investor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nutshell summary of the book would be that we should invest in assets that could actually make more money for us. And that risk is an integral part of high-profit investments, and therefore, one must not be scared of losing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and anyone can understand the concept easily. If you want to take a step towards understanding investment, this book is a great first step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 Oct 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/10/13/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-by-Robert-Kiyosaki/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/10/13/Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad-by-Robert-Kiyosaki/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Apartment 16 by Adam Nevill</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Barrington House, an upmarket block in London, there is an empty apartment. No one goes in and no one comes out, and it’s been that way for 50 years, until the night a watchman hears a disturbance after midnight and is drawn to investigate. What he experiences is enough to change his life forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after, a young American woman, Apryl, arrives at Barrington House. She’s been left an apartment by her mysterious Great Aunt Lillian who died in strange circumstances. Rumours claim Lillian was mad, but her diary suggests she was implicated in a horrific and inexplicable event decades ago. Determined to learn something of this eccentric woman, Apryl begins to unravel the hidden story of Barrington House. She discovers that a transforming, evil force still inhabits the building, and that the doorway to Apartment 16 is a gateway to something altogether more terrifying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Barrington House, an upmarket block, housing a crowd of rich residents, doesn’t really seem to be as rich and exotic in its interior. From the first page, it feels dark and spooky. The author has successfully set the tone and kept it throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has two protagonists—Apryl and Seth. Both the characters present strong personalities. Apryl’s visit to her Great Aunt’s apartment makes her question the circumstances under which her Great Aunt Lillian, died.  Lillian’s diary expresses how she and her neighbours at the Barrington House are haunted by a man and what led to the death of her husband. The events turned her crazier with every passing day until she died. Apryl resolves to find out the cause of her death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seth, the porter and night guard, is drawn to apartment 16 of the Barrington House and gets dragged in a messed-up spiral of obsession that is reflected in his artwork.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apryl and Seth slowly unfold the story from their perspectives till they finally come together and bring an end to the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every character is well developed. Even the side characters are purposefully put in and have a significant role to play in the progress of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Apartment 16 is not your classic ghost story. There are no pulling the sheets, messing with the lights, running in the woods, etc. It is much more intense and goes beyond the barriers of right-and-wrong and real-and-fake. The terror behind the door of apartment 16 is known to everyone but not yet witnessed by everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot is unique and the back story gives depth to the characters. The story is a little slow in some places. But the author is able to build up the tension well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending is unpredictable and lives up to the reader’s expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book fits the bill of a great Horror, Supernatural, Paranormal, Mystery, Thriller, and Fantasy Fiction. Highly recommended for this Halloween Season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Oct 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/10/02/Apartment-16-by-Adam-Nevill/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/10/02/Apartment-16-by-Adam-Nevill/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Empower Your Super Powers by Anjali Gursahaney</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you ever look around the world and feel this can’t be it? Are we only supposed to follow the rat race and deal with issues all our lives?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve been told what to do and how to do things since we were kids. As humans, we are all superheroes who are blessed with the superpower to control our lives and live accordingly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You, my friend, are the creator and you can make your life as amazing as you want it to be. Today, you take charge!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got the chance to read “Empower Your Super Powers” at a time when I was facing many doubts—doubts about my career, doubts about my future, doubts about my emotions, doubts about everything in general. I was feeling emotionally numb and couldn’t focus on anything. When I held the book in my hand, I knew it was meant to be read at that very moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would often find myself thinking about stuff that I had no control over. Instead of taking action, I would waste my time thinking about the future and lamenting over my past. Until I read this book. This book helped me realise how a lot of things I had unconsciously been focussing on were a barrier to my personal growth and peace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks about negative emotions, toxic people, and self-criticism, and how to deal with them. The author believes that all these things can be tackled, only if you know yourself. For that, she suggests the use of just three things: Journal, Mirror, and Quiet Environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 10 chapters and each chapter focuses on a different personality trait/emotion that the reader needs to address. The author explains how each trait/emotion is a hindrance to one’s growth and how it could be turned into power just by changing one’s outlook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author suggests having strong boundaries, letting go of toxic people and thoughts, accepting changes, talking to one’s inner child, and always manifesting good things for oneself among others as a way to heal oneself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is easy to read and understand. It resonates with readers because the author uses real-life examples. She talks about the common problems we suffer and we all relate to. Whether it is lack of privacy at home, fight with friends and family, or ghosting on dating sites. She talks about everything from a young adult’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also, unapologetically, talks about the mistakes she has made in life and how she moved on and grew with them. It takes guts to accept your mistakes and more so to talk about them in front of the public. In that way, she is a great teacher as she helps the reader find and accept their mistakes and grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike other self-help books, this one doesn’t preach. Rather, it is a friendly monologue of the author for her readers who she unconditionally wants to help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to deal heal your past wounds, present anxiety, and future fears, this book is for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Sep 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/09/24/Empower-Your-Super-Powers-by-Anjali-Gursahaney/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/09/24/Empower-Your-Super-Powers-by-Anjali-Gursahaney/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Monsoon Lament by Nirvaan Verma</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a premium apartment complex in suburban Mumbai, four unrelated people inhabit different homes in the same wing of the building. Ravin Gupta, a reclusive painter. Asavari Tripathi, a shy, timid homemaker. Sharat Bindal, a young entrepreneur, and womaniser. Evana D’souza, a manipulative fashion model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ravin is trying to paint the image of his feminine ideal on canvas and struggling to find a girl to pose for him so that he can visualise his painting. Unable to get over the death of his ex-girlfriend, he finds a way out of his life of seclusion and obscurity, but not without costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asavari loves her husband, but he is cold, uncaring and unresponsive in bed. She volunteers at an NGO and is a deeply humane person, she also paints as a hobby and listens to ghazals in her free time. She breaks the boundaries society creates for women and charts her journey of emancipation and finding her true identity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharat is a successful entrepreneur but also a smooth-talking womaniser and a vandal with alpha-male characteristics. He is driven by his demons and aggressive instincts but beneath the layers of bravado hides a fragile man carrying scars from his traumatic childhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evana is a supermodel who carries many insecurities, to counter them she tries to enamour young, rich men so that she can manipulate them for their money to support her expensive lifestyle. She goes on a journey of self-discovery from being a brazen pleasure-seeker to making mature life choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A series of crucial events and pressing circumstances lead to role reversals between the four individuals. This transformation in their personalities and personal destinies makes them discover a facet of their personality which was initially hidden from their selves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Monsoon Lament is an interesting take on complex human behaviour. The story is unique as many hidden and ignorable aspects of the human mind are highlighted in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader witnesses various dilemmas in the minds of the characters. The characters second guess their judgements and make an attempt to change themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within the eight months of the story’s timeline, we see two drastically different personalities of each character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though I really enjoyed the vision of the story, I despised the patriarchal narrative. &lt;em&gt;Evana&lt;/em&gt; is a gold digger. &lt;em&gt;Sharat&lt;/em&gt; is an abusive womaniser “but beneath the layers of bravado hides a fragile man carrying scars from his traumatic childhood” &lt;em&gt;Asavari&lt;/em&gt; is an ideal wife “draped in a…saree, Asavari gave off the homemaker vibe” who is stuck in an unyielding marriage but tries her best to woo her husband. &lt;em&gt;Ravin&lt;/em&gt; is a privileged guy who believes his love for art means renouncing the world and tries to force his opinion on others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The depiction of these characters and some of their dialogues were serious cringe moments for me. Like: “Asavari always felt compelled to ask Vismay his permission to add male friends to her account.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are contradictory to themselves. For example: Vismay talks about Mumbai being modern as divorce is very normal, but he can’t talk about or have sex with his own wife because he has “very conservative ideas about sex.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a lack of character development arc. 50% through the story, there is a 180-degree change in Evana and Asvari’s characters. Similarly, we later find Sharat and Ravin’s complete change of personality all too suddenly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story was nice, and the idea of humans being capable of complete transformation was boldly highlighted. What would have made it a better read for me is relatable characters and genuine transformation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/09/02/a-monsoon-lament-by-nirvaan-verma/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/09/02/a-monsoon-lament-by-nirvaan-verma/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Farther by Chaitanya Desale</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life is unpredictable, even though we always desire ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if life offered you innumerable tragedies, sorrowful pains &amp;amp; dreadful agonies?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Would you still have the courage to try and thrive to get what you want? And to be the so called ‘Mr. Fortunate’?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or will you keep blaming your insecurities &amp;amp; failures and choose to be a fiasco?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A sweet couple, Manbir &amp;amp; Nivia, were living with their toddler, Ruhi. They stayed farther from their respective families, cursed by both their parents for having an inter-caste marriage. Manbir was a robotics engineer and while working hard on his dream project to make India’s first AI robot, he failed in his family responsibilities, which was followed by his wife, Nivia’s demise. And when all options were lost, Manbir had to struggle to look after his daughter Ruhi, while continuing to work on his company projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will he ever be able to be a great father for his motherless child? Will he ever be able to make India’s first AI robot? And how will he find a way to look after his child during his office hours? To know more, read ‘FARTHER - A Fabulous Tale of a Troubled Father.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Farther is a tragic story of a man, Manbir, who is trying to achieve his dream of making the first-ever AI robot, while destiny constantly keeps adding troubles in his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story talks about career aspirations and relationships with parents, spouse, kids, friends, colleagues, and rivals. We see Manbir juggling each of his responsibilities while poorly failing in all. The entire story is a journey at understanding how he can have it all at once without failing in any.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the character development throughout the story. The story is, as I like it, well-rounded, with detailed updates about the lives of every character, leaving no loose ends. However, that made the story a little slow and repetitive, which could have been avoided. Anyways, I really liked the overall flow of the story. As you read the story, you fall in love with each character of the story. You try to reason with their qualities, whether good or bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author’s attempt to turn an obvious villain into a morally grey character is impressive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story kept transitioning between first- and third-person narration, and the climax, I feel, could have been more powerful. The fight between Danny and Manbir could have been more direct and urgent. It was dragged and lacked the impact it was supposed to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the highlighted message in the story: “However, the most important thing you’ve to know and always remember is to never ever bargain your family time just to work for a few more hours.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this story, I feel that I ought to spend more time with family and friends. Work and money may come and go, but family and friends are forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I find this book a must-read for people struggling in their lives, trying to find a balance between work and life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Aug 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/08/24/Farther-by-Chaitanya-Desale/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/08/24/Farther-by-Chaitanya-Desale/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Little Women by Louisa May Alcott</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generations of readers young and old, male and female, have fallen in love with the March sisters of Louisa May Alcott’s most popular and enduring novel, &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt;. Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is set around the American Civil War. What starts as a lowly life of 4 sisters and their mother, grows into themes of family love, friendship, romance, and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written in the late 1860s, the novel is way ahead of its time. The author boldly addresses various feminist issues—women being the bread earner of the family, pursuing their interests, denying a marriage proposal just because they don’t want it, division of household work in marriage, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how all the characters have been developed in the story. Each has a special quality. Meg is sweet-natured and actively manages her house, Jo is creative and strong, Beth is shy, sweet, and musical, and Amy is artistic, social, and spoiled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first part, we see more of the four main characters as a bunch of sisters—going about their lives, fighting with each other but constantly making up, too. We learn about their ideologies and their dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the second part, we see them as individuals with more of their individual personalities and priorities. Their ideologies shape them and how they do in their lives with regards to love and relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the strong personalities that the characters unapologetically possess. They do not shy away from speaking their mind, neither from asking forgiveness if they do something wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only thing I didn’t like in the story was when Jo’s cutting off her hair was treated as her loss of one beauty. As if it was only her hair that made her beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is heart-wrenching and tear-jerking yet romantic and funny and sweet. The little gestures the characters do for each other made me go “aww”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The language is simple and easy to read. The reader is hooked to the story from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Aug 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/08/18/Little-Women-by-Louisa-May-Alcott/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/08/18/Little-Women-by-Louisa-May-Alcott/</guid> </item> <item> <title>As You Like It by William Shakespeare</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;about-the-book&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the book:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt; is a story about love and family politics. Brother trying to keep brother out of legacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oliver treats Orlando badly after their father’s death and takes over Orlando’s part of the inheritance. On the other hand, Celia’s father deposes Rosalind’s father, his brother. This politics though help in bringing the characters together and completing the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a wrestling match, Rosalind sees Orlando and is impressed by his wrestling skills. She gifts him a chain, and they fall in love without revealing their feelings to each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Orlando comes to know that Oliver has been trying to kill him, he runs away and reaches the Forest of Arden, where he carves Rosalind’s name on trees with poems dedicated to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosalind runs away from her house when threatened by her uncle, Celia’s father, Duke Frederick. Celia and Touchstone accompany her to the Forest of Arden, disguising themselves—Rosalind as a gentleman named Ganymede and Celia as a shepherdess named Aliena.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosalind notices the carvings and is informed by Celia that it is none other than Orlando.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire story unfolds as Rosalind confronts Orlando as Ganymede about Orlando’s love for Rosalind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As You Like It&lt;/em&gt; is a light-hearted story about love-at-first-sight. The story takes various funny twists as more characters add on. It is a short read. I was able to finish it in 3-4 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the simplicity of the story. The majority of the story is set in a forest, where the characters are far away from their titles and wealth, living their lives in exile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story had a scope to add more details about the brothers’ enmity. What I didn’t like in the story was Phoebe being married off to Silvius even though she didn’t like him, and Oliver’s feelings for Orlando and the sudden change in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the characters are really interesting and well crafted. They have strong opinions and don’t hesitate from voicing them in front of others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosalind:&lt;/strong&gt; Rosalind is a smart, strong, soft-hearted, and clever character. She is wise with words and knows how to influence someone. When she disguises herself as Ganymede, a handsome young man, she becomes a Love Guru for Orlando, Silvius, and Phoebe and executes the happy ending in the story. She is the best character in the entire play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orlando:&lt;/strong&gt; Orlando is an attractive young man. Being neglected by his brother, he lacks education and gentlemanly qualities. However, he believes he has great potential. Victory in the wrestling match proves the same. He is a hopeless romantic and shows it by carving Rosalind’s name and poetries dedicated to her on trees. He takes Ganymede’s (Rosalind’s) advice and tries to become a better lover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celia:&lt;/strong&gt; Celia, Rosalind’s cousin, is a warm and emotional character. She decides to follow Rosalind into exile in disguise of Aliena, a shepherdess, and falls in love with Oliver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver:&lt;/strong&gt; Oliver is a cruel brother. He does every possible thing to get his brother, Orlando, out and even attempts to get him killed in the wrestling match. Celia’s father employs Oliver to find his missing brother (Rosalind’s father). Oliver’s character takes a 180° turn when Orlando saves him from a hungry lioness. He later falls in love with Celia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story is interesting, a bit more details and characters’ backstories could have been a plus point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are a Shakespeare fan or want to try something new (classics, plays).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jul 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/07/29/As-You-Like-it-by-William-Shakespeare/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/07/29/As-You-Like-it-by-William-Shakespeare/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Poetarrati Ponder 2020 by Ashok Subramanian</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poetarrati Ponder 2020&lt;/em&gt; is a compilation of poem reviews written by poet and author Ashok Subramanian during the year 2020. What started as a blog in medium.com, ended us as a comprehensive journal of appreciating fine poetry. The book covers more than 20 poems from 11 poets across the world. Praised for its deep analysis and sublime connects, Ponder brings out the fine elements of poetry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poetarrati Ponder 2020&lt;/em&gt; consists of poems covering different genres and themes: Nature, Seasons, Time, Life, Death, Farewell, Human Emotions, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is divided into 14 sections. Each section is a review of a single poem or comparison of 2 poems following the same theme. The author presents different perspectives of each theme with the help of those poetries. These poetries also include haikus and free verses. The writing style is simple. The author first presents the poems and highlights the common theme between them. He then delves into reviewing each poem. He uses extracts from the poems and also takes the help of quotes from other writers to emphasize his points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each poetry is different from the other, even if the underlying theme is the same. A myriad of emotions can be felt as you read the poems and the author’s commentary—nostalgia, resentment, hopefulness, sadness, provocation, etc. With every poem the reader falls deeper into introspection and puts in a conscious effort in understanding the world around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When death beckons, I would be ready… Like rainbows after rains Like smiles after pains…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;— Shweta Hitesh Joshi&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has done a great job at understanding not just the poetry but the poet and their intentions behind each poetry. Works of the following poets are introduced in this book: &lt;em&gt;Shweta Hitesh Joshi, E.J. Rose, Desiree Driesenaar, Sourabha Rao, Poornima Laxmeshwar, Vaishnavi M., Adam Prockstem Smith, Sakshi Arora, D.G. Torrens, Murray Alfredson, and Nicole Oaten&lt;/em&gt;. The author connected with these poets on various social platforms like LinkedIn and Medium. He fell in love with their work, and so does the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a simplicity in each poem. They are easy to understand. However, the way in which the author explore each word and phrase of each poetry, he introduces a whole other dimension of the poem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended to all the poetry and nature lovers as well as to those looking for an easy read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>17 Jul 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/07/17/Poetarrati-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/07/17/Poetarrati-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Cursed House</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abir found out about Kyra’s ancestral house, which she hadn’t been to since she was 5.

At the first glance, the book gives you an impression of being a horror story, starting with an ancestral haunted house with the backdrop of thunder strikes. You may think stereotypical of it, although these very elements set the stage for the upcoming surprises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you reach this stage, there is no way you are stopping until you finish the book and discover the truth hidden behind those pillars you see on the cover.

He lives his life as per the unknown book ‘A Good Boyfriend is a Terrible Ex-boyfriend’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A week before her marriage, Vian’s love, Amyra is gang-raped and Vian is brutally beaten up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vian, in a stage between life and death, is asked by GOD, what will he give Him if he is granted a second life to save Amyra. The trade done by Vian decides his destiny and faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a screenplay. It is the story of Vian, who is trying to help Amyra, his love, come out of her trauma. The book is written using a combination of Hindi and English language. Shayaris, poetries, and a majority of dialogues are in Hindi. While the scene description and narration is in English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around multiple themes including romance, rape, PTSD, mental health, fantasy, etc. The book proudly stands as India’s longest love story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is pretty different from all the other books I have read. The narration is direct and easy to read and would easily appeal to Bollywood enthusiasts because of its dialogue writing and execution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editing could have been better. At many points, the sentences are complex and lack punctuations. Tenses are inconsistent. Too much seems to be going on with continuously shifting years, poetries, and excerpts from a fictional book that Vian loves. However, the dialogue writing and poetries/shayaris make it enjoyable. The author is able to keep the reader hooked till the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Amyra and Vian represent strong characters. Their fight with their lives and destiny is well depicted. I love how Vian sticks with Amyra and does everything in his hands to take Amyra out of the hell hole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is funny, serious, and emotional. It is an interesting read and offers something unique of it its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a slow burn. Trigger Warning: The book contains themes like rape and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>17 Jun 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/17/The-Beautiful-Sky-by-Harshwardhan-Patil/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/17/The-Beautiful-Sky-by-Harshwardhan-Patil/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Joey Loves Granny by Nidhi Sharma</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Joey Loves Granny” takes an emotional and uplifting look at the relationship between a grandmother and her grandson. When Joey senses that Granny is sad, it fills his heart with empathy. He knows that Granny misses Grandpa. So, what does Joey do? He can sure make her laugh. But will Granny stop missing Grandpa? Let’s dive into their world and find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Joey Loves Granny” is a children’s picture book. It is an innocent story of Joey and his granny. Joey is a naughty kid and his granny is always there by his side to get him out of troubles. One day, Joey realises that his granny is sad and tries to make her happy. The story revolves around the themes such as love, loss, empathy, overcoming grief, and embracing happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author’s writing style is simple and can be understood by a 5-year-old. There are few words like mischievous, inspire, whine, etc., that might be difficult for such young kids to understand, hence, making it a great source to improve their vocabulary and introduce them to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Illustrations designed by Amit Sharma are relevant and colourful. Pastel colours are used, which are soothing to look at. Emotions are well presented throughout. These illustrations can be used to present the story to children who have not learned how to read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book contains discussion questions for kids to understand the story at a deeper level. It is a great way to initiate a conversation with kids about love for grandparents and empathy in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is currently available on Kindle and will soon be released in paperback format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for children of all ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jun 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/03/Joey-Loves-Granny-by-Nidhi-Sharma/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/03/Joey-Loves-Granny-by-Nidhi-Sharma/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Devil's Intern by Jayme Phelps</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After making a deal with the Devil, Anna Westfall is now in her own personal hell on earth. The thing is, she now has the ability to make deals of her own. With great power comes even higher stakes. Now, will she do what’s right to save her friend from the same fate?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Devil’s Intern is a story about Anna who is dead and is now serving her sentence on the Earth. A pure fantasy fiction, it is a unique take on life after death and soul reaping as understood by different religions. In this story, the people who are dead are either sent to hell or made to stay on the Earth to serve their sentence. Despite being on the Earth and living a pretty much human life, they can’t meet their loved ones and are guided by serious principles, which if not followed can lead them to the prism—the jail of their worst fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title is relevant, but I found the cover to not be the right representation of the plot. The surroundings give no idea about the setting of the story. The personality of the characters as described in the story does not seem to be the same as depicted in the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Language is lucid and easy to understand. The story is well-paced and keeps the reader hooked from the beginning when one is introduced to the scene and an exciting world of witches, warlocks, vampires, and psychics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Characters are rounded and serve their purpose well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anna is a soulless, commonly known as void, an exception in this fantasy world. She is a psychic and can understand people’s intentions by seeing the colour of their eyes. She discovers her ability to sign deals with people, which involves them having to give up their souls in return for a favour. This ability leads her into a serious trouble when she is asked to work under the Devil and reap more souls.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rachel is a witch. The witch community is generally apprehensive of Anna, but Rachel becomes her good friend after Anna saves her.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Matt, a fairy, is Anna’s lover and is supportive whenever she needs him. He is one of the most adorable characters of the story.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stephan is a soul reaper who signs the deal with Anna in the first place and leads her to the hellish life she is living.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Silas, the Devil, a lawyer for the human world, is the one for whom Stephan works. He receives the reaped souls and passes his judgement for the sentence they would be serving.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is written in first person, past tense. The author takes a quick detour through a flashback to tell us about Anna’s back story and later, the story unfolds chronologically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were several questions in story that were left unanswered and have a scope for further development. But I am hoping that those would be answered in the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a unique theme in fantasy genre and an easy read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/28/Devils-Intern-by-Jayme-Phelps/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/28/Devils-Intern-by-Jayme-Phelps/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Final Delivery and Eight Others by Mark Thorson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final Delivery is a collection of stories set in or connected to, far northern landscapes with characters who have either made a decision, or are about to make one, that will change their life’s trajectory—often in a manner or direction that they had not anticipated. A Professor of Ethics hires an assassin, a despondent trust fund baby who tries his hand at running drugs, and there are two good old northern boys who have always lived for the hunt, the kill, but have never contemplated death. These are stories about change, about awakenings, about paths that are chosen without clarity of what those paths hold. There’s a failed Hollywood screenwriter, a washed-up NHL hockey player, and an under accomplished woman who married the wrong man—all at the brink of life’s fragile breaking point. There’s a small-town braggart who is about to meet his father for the first time, and also a lonely checkout girl in her final days, who lived her life without ever asserting herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These stories in Final Delivery cross through race, culture, politics, and religion with unique characters who are faced with the simple struggles in life that challenge us all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Final Delivery” is a collection of nine short stories across genres—Slice of Life, Inspirational, Emotional, and Thriller. All the stories talk about different feelings the characters are going through. We see the characters confused, scared, nostalgic, inspired, broken, and frustrated. The emotions feel real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand. The writer has done a great job at providing very visual descriptions of the characters and locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the story “The Gift”. It is the most descriptive and is very motivational. The story is about a young ice hockey prodigy whose ideal is the Great Magician. His ideal inspires him to work on the details of his sport and achieve great levels of fame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first story, “The Dope Runner”, is about the guilt of doing illegal work and the constant fears attached to it. The story is well written. The character, Jake, is involved in some illegal task. Even though he has completed it, he has apprehensions and is worried that something wrong might happen. It talks about the dilemmas faced by people who have done something wrong. The ending was smartly written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fifty Dollars Assassin” is a story about a professor hiring an assassin. It is another story about inner fears and concerns as you are not sure if you are right or wrong. Here the professor is scared of losing his 18 years youngers wife to a fit and handsome assassin. The presentation of his wife’s emotions and the professor’s jealousy is subtle but prominent in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Malfunction Junction” is Chet and Howard’s trip on a hunting day. The simple plot turns pretty dark pretty quick. I loved the drastic contrast of the characters’ personalities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A Trip Back Down” is a banished ice hockey player’s life story. Watching the kids play the game reminds him of his earlier times. On being asked by the kids what it is like to have been, he shares the reality of life with them. A not-so-hopeful but the truth of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Last Stop at the Stop ‘N Go” is a dying girl’s slice of life where she tries to speak out her feelings but fails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Stranger’s Day” is the story of a guy called Space who has never met his father. And then one day, finally, it was decided that they were going to meet. We see him wait for his father while having a conversation with a stranger. The story is an emotional one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ellen Ray had been having a hard time with her husband. “A Good Piece Is Hard To Find” is about her trip to a bar where she finally tries to acknowledge her feelings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Final Delivery” is a dark and depressive story of a frustrated Dominos delivery guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the stories are vastly different from one another and take the reader to new worlds and time periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for an emotionally connecting read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/13/Final-Delivery-by-Mark-Thorson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/13/Final-Delivery-by-Mark-Thorson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Looking For Alaska by John Green</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before. Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After. Nothing is ever the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alaska is a mysterious character. She loves to have fun, drink, and smoke, but beneath this facade is an extremely emotional and a broken person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist, Pudge’s character is very relatable. His ordinary life, after arriving at Culver Creek, has taken a drastic turn. In an attempt to adjust to the new life and make friends, he gets involved in drinking and smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Looking for Alaska” talks about friendship over everything else. I love how all the friends stand by each other in tough times. The characters are well crafted, whether it is Alaska’s attention to minute details, Pudge’s innocence, Takumi’s humour, or the Colonel’s desire to always support his friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like John Green’s other stories, this one is yet another tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Green’s writing style is easy to understand. His descriptions are very detailed and visual. His stories are fun to read because there are so many hidden messages and quotes that you can relate to. The more time you read the book, the more you understand what he is trying to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how he talks about the labyrinth we are stuck in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“He was shaken by the overwhelming revelation that the headlong race between his misfortunes and his dreams was at that moment reaching the finish line. The rest was darkness. ‘Damn it,’ he sighed. ‘How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!’ ”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That’s the mystery, isn’t it? Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is he trying to escape–the world or the end of it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not life or death, the labyrinth”… “So what is it?”… “Suffering…doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That’s the problem. Bolivar was talking about pain.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Green talks so much about it in the book and let the reader wonder, letting them explore the questions he generates.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-between-looking-for-alaska-and-paper-towns&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison between “Looking For Alaska” and “Paper Towns”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was shocked to see that “Looking For Alaska” follows the same theme as “Paper Towns” by the same author. The similarities were insane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The personalities of the protagonist, Pudge, and the girl he loves, Alaska, is the same as Quentin and Margo in “Paper Towns”.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The rich and scrawny guy bullied by people and his way-out-of-the-league, pretty, and prankster love interest.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pranks are central to both the stories.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In both the stories, the girl happens to upheaval the normal life of the protagonist and their group of friends with her bottled up thoughts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The moral of the story remains the same: You can never know what’s going on in someone’s mind. You can never know a person as well as you think you can.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few notable differences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Both the stories unfold differently.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The quest for the truth in “Looking For Alaska” is different from the quest to find Margo in “Paper Towns”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;While the clues were dropped in “Paper Towns” that helped Quentin search for Margo, Pudge and his friends in “Looking for Alaska” relied solely on their conversations, making the story more real.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you liked “Paper Towns” then you’ll definitely love “Looking for Alaska”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/02/Looking-For-Alaska-by-John-Green/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/02/Looking-For-Alaska-by-John-Green/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Invisible Girlfriend by Ekta Renu Chandna</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You cannot believe your luck that the new girl in school who is as beautiful as the sunrise, is willing to date you! You fall deeply in love with her. And on a fine day, while having a romantic candle-light dinner with your gorgeous girlfriend under the star-lit sky, with a cold wind blowing, she just . . . disappears, into thin air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baffling, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what happened to Siddharth a.k.a. Sid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where did she go? What happened? How can this happen? Read the novella to find out the mystery of the invisible girlfriend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invisible Girlfriend is a unique tale of love that you have never encountered before!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot of “Invisible Girlfriend” promises an interesting break from the usual romance stories. With all the suspense and mysticism, it offers something different from the usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story had a scope to become tear-jerker and heart-wrenching fiction, but it lacked emotional depth. The characters could have been more powerful and memorable. The scenes seem to appear one after another without letting the audience connect. I feel the editing could have been worked upon a little more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover of the book does not represent the story. While the cover may hint at a sad story, the book is actually paranormal fiction. The binding is very stiff, making it difficult to hold in one hand. The best part is that it has easy readability. The short length of the book makes it a quick read for anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light and quick read or something of a palate cleanser after a heavy or emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/29/Invisible-Girlfriend-by-Ekta-Renu-Chandna/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/29/Invisible-Girlfriend-by-Ekta-Renu-Chandna/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Mystery Within You by Megha Bhauka</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariniti is a young woman, a mother and a wife who used to be always tied up with her household chores. Amid lockdown she planned to transform her life by intense meditation. She was aware of the benefits of meditation but had no previous experience. All she knew was that meditation brings peace, happiness and abundance in life. As she couldn’t go outside, meet her friends or do anything, she planned to go inside and explore her path of life. She wanted to connect with the universe and know all about her reasons for incarnation. When she started her journey, she was not able to do it much but with time she improved. With her journey of meditation, not only did she get peace and happiness, she realised how magical this journey is. She unlocked all the inner realms of the human body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She learned how the universe can help you live a good life. She learned how the conscience can travel through time and came to know about her past life and reason for her incarnation. She learned how she can be strong like a tree in any weather and how she can utilize her time more effectively and still absorb energy from five elements of the universe. She also learned how the universe has gifted everyone 7 to 9 different gifts. Read this book to know more about her journey &amp;amp; how she unlocked these gifts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my school, we were taught about the importance of pranayama, yoga, and hand mudras. But like any other student, I hardly paid any heed to the compulsory boringness of 30-40 minutes. However, lately, I have been very much captivated by the topic of spirituality and the Higher Power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mystery Within You&lt;/em&gt; is one such book that intrigues you to know what your inner self is capable of doing. The book takes the reader on Pariniti’s journey where she finds the blocks in her life and heals herself with the help of meditation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariniti’s journey is like a video game where she has embarked on a journey. As she unlocks various levels, she receives gifts from God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also get to know about chakras and mudras and their significance over a person’s body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is different from the others that I have read in this genre because it is not a guide to meditation. As the author says in the book, “There are as many forms of meditation as there are people who practise it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is totally up to you how you want to find yourself. Meditation is not a mathematical question to be solved. Instead, it is more of finding your own process to study that will allow you to solve all the questions at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved reading about Pariniti’s experience of Past Life Regression and Akashic Records. It helped Pariniti look into her past and future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the cover of the book. It signifies that the mystery is inside you and nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to know what all you are capable of doing through meditation and are excited to embark on this journey, then this book is definitely recommended. Whether you have never meditated or have been meditating for a long time, this book will definitely give you insights into the possibilities you might never have thought of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/25/The-Mystery-Within-You-by-Megha-Bhauka/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/25/The-Mystery-Within-You-by-Megha-Bhauka/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Puma: A Soldier's Dog by Richa Kashyap</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Indie pup, looking for food, enters a cantonment area one day. A pack of dogs, led by their vicious leader, Sir Kattapa, thrashes him for entering their territory. But the same night, he meets his Dadda and his life changes forever. Puma, as he is fondly called, then on, only dreams of becoming a soldier like his Dadda. A soldier whose aim is to save lives, not take lives. A sudden terrorist attack on his Dadda’s unit gives Puma a chance to prove his mettle. Puma’s journey of transforming into Commando Puma is a tale of adventure, fun, hard work and sacrifice, and love and hope. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you love dogs? Do you respect the army? Do you like tear-jerker fiction? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes” then forget the review and grab your copy of &lt;em&gt;Puma: A Soldier’s Dog by Richa Kashyap&lt;/em&gt; right away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puma, the narrator, a cute indie doggo, is the pet every hooman needs in their lives. He is smart, loyal, brave, and strong. Basically a good boy. I love how the story is presented from the perspective of Puma as if being presented by a kid (like the protagonist, Jack, in &lt;em&gt;Room by Emma Donoghue&lt;/em&gt;). I feel that a little more work could have been done on editing and paragraph breaks while switching between speakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire journey of Puma running away from his home to being adopted by his Dadda up till the end of the story is a roller coaster of sad, happy, heartbreaking, and brave moments. The book is a testament to the loyalty and innocence of dogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book will make you fall in love with dogs and also make you cry for whatever Puma is going through. The author talks about the condition of street dogs and army dogs. The moral of the story is to adopt indie and street dogs not only as pets but also include them in the army, which predominantly uses Labradors and German Shepherds. Overall, it is an emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is apt for all ages. I would highly recommend it to the younger generation to teach them empathy, kindness towards animals, and respect for the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Such short little lives our pets have to spend with us, and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day.” —John Grogan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/23/Puma-by-Richa-Kashyap/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/23/Puma-by-Richa-Kashyap/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Yatra: Udaan Jaari Hai by Baghishayar</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;जीवन के सरल, सहज किन्तु गहरे अनुभव जब इतनी प्रामाणिकता से कहे जाएं कि उन्हें अस्वीकार करना संभव ही न हो, जब कहे हुए शब्दों और व्यक्तिगत अनुभवों में कोई अंतर शेष ना रहे तो ऐसे शब्दों का, ऐसी अभिव्यक्तियों का असर एक लम्बे समय तक रहता है। ये संग्रह ऐसी ही अभिव्यक्तियों का एक अनूठा संकलन हैं। सत्य- भिन्न-भिन्न रूपों में अभिव्यक्त होता, खरा, कड़वा किन्तु प्रामाणिक। ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baghishayar presents to the readers the simple realities of life in the simplest possible manner. On each page, a few lines of poetry are followed by the writer’s comment or explantation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He starts by talking about himself. Then he takes the readers through his life, his incomplete love and his break up, tells us the importance of friends and family,talks about dreams, and discusses the bitter truths of life. Each part of the book is relatable and easily resonates with the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is made into a cute square shape and the cover picture is relevant to the topics written about. The cover is poised and so is the poetry inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a soothing and easy read. Despite me not usually reading Hindi books, this one was very easy to get into and understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very quick read and can be finished in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/20/Yatra-by-Baghishayar/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/20/Yatra-by-Baghishayar/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Why Not Me? by Anubhav Agrawal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A hopeless romantic, Anubhav had been looking for the love of his life. When Zoya accepted his online friend request, he felt an instant connection. Soon, he was falling deeply in love with her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For four years, first as friend and then as boyfriend, Anubhav waited for the day that Zoya would fall for him too. It never came. He had fallen in love with a person who had never really cared about him. He thought that if Zoya ever left him, he would be devastated. Turns out, it was the best gift ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Why Not Me? A Feeling of Millions, Anubhav looks back on his roller-coaster ride of being crazy in love to heartbroken, expressing in words what countless others have felt. His message? A broken heart can make you a stronger person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already a national bestseller, Why Not Me? is a story of learning to love yourself again. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can understand why this book is supposed to be “A Feeling of Millions”. In the time of online dating, it is very easy to fall in love with someone without even meeting them. Anubhav’s story follows a similar plot, and he falls in love with Zoya.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the author, it’s his real-life story. So, I am at no place to be the love guru and tell what should or should not have happened throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But putting myself in the place of a reader and reviewer, the following is my opinion about the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anubhav is a lonely guy, desperate to find love. When Zoya accepts his friend request, it is like finding treasure for him. They start chatting. While Zoya has made it clear since the beginning that she is not interested in a relationship, Anubhav is a hopeless romantic. He keeps pushing her to trust him and love him back. After some time, when she does confess her interest in Anubhav, she still appears to be distant and unemotional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anubhav’s character is like any other teenager, who thinks of life as a bed of roses. They think that other person loves them as much as they do and puts as much effort as they do. But that’s not true and they must put in front their self-respect before anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand, but I felt it lacked emotional depth. The fear, the desperation, of losing one’s love is not visible even though that’s what the author has tried to present to the readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There or not many moments of sidelining from this story; there is no focus on career, friends, or family. There is no character development throughout the story. The story is cliché and predictable. I was able to read it in around 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blurb states, “He thought that if Zoya ever left him, he would be devastated. Turns out, it was the best gift ever.” However, in the book, we never reach that point. The “moved on” stage is there, but the “moving on” stage is not there. It feels like the purpose of the book was not met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is able to resonate with millions of people, but HOW are they supposed to “move on” or “prioritise their self-respect”. In the end, the author provides tips to the young ones, whatever he has learned from this experience and many others. But doesn’t everyone know it? Isn’t the major concern about HOW to implement it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend it to you if you are looking for a light read or if you think you might be in a relationship that is not worth your efforts. If you are looking for someone to give words to your situation, this is your book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/15/Why-Not-Me-by-Anubhav-Agrawal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/15/Why-Not-Me-by-Anubhav-Agrawal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>War of Mercy by P. J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is the third novel in P.J.Berman’s Silrith series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bennvika’s civil war has spilt beyond its borders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a desperate bid to regain a foothold on regional power, Silrith, the rightful Queen of Bennvika, has pushed the Etrovansian despot, Ravla, back to the Dunestra River. But the army blocking her path is far from the only mortal peril she faces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across the sea, Bennvika itself is in chaos. Nobody holds sway over the entire nation, though many claim it as multiple factions vie for supremacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bloody conflict of attrition continues. Can Silrith bring an end to the widespread suffering? Or does fate have other plans?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The war begins with a basic fight for rights. When Silrith was taken down her throne with trickery by Jostan, she vowed to earn back her Kingdom. The fight was between Silrith and Ezrina (who were wrongly thrown off their thrones); Jostan (who wanted to colonise the entire Kingdom of Bennvika); and Zethun (who wanted democracy). The simple agenda has turned into politics and the greed of people to rule the kingdom or just parts of it will make them do anything. The allies can’t be trusted and the foes can’t be understood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, like any other book by P. J. Berman, starts with chaos. Everything is a mess. There are attacks being planned by some while the others are trying to keep their heads low to keep themselves safe and come up with a strategy. We see innovative strategies being discussed and plotted, but there are hardly any wars throughout the story except in the beginning and at the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style, as always, is brilliant, and the story keeps you hooked right from the beginning. Silrith becomes more resolute than ever. With her guides and mentors now gone, she has to make some real decisions, which she does without a flinch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina is another powerful character that I have loved immensely since the beginning of the series. However, she is overshadowed in this part. I desperately wish more could have been done with her strong personality and patriotism towards her tribe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jostan’s role is very minimal and unmemorable in this book. Other kingdoms’ leaders’ fights and strategies make up most of the book. Bezekarl suddenly takes a centre stage and evolves to become much more powerful than in the previous books.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun and Fayenda’s role come towards the end of the book and creates a bridge to the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt that a lot more could have been done with the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you would expect from this genre, many characters die. How the story took a turn was unpredictable and disheartening. But as you say, everything is fair in love and war. Well, this is a war and pretty brutal at that. You lose a lot to gain something in wars like these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really hope that the next book comes with a lot more plot twists and stronger than ever characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/12/War-Of-Mercy-by-PJ-Berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/12/War-Of-Mercy-by-PJ-Berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Love's Garden by Nandini Bhattacharya</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1898. India is ruled by the British, and India’s women are ruled by British masters as well as Indian men. A desperate young widow sacrifices her firstborn child to save herself from ultimate dishonor. She marries a stranger, but her damaged second family pays dearly for this Faustian bargain. Then, an extraordinary atonement, strange liaisons in politics and love—spanning the two world wars and the Indian independence movement—help her descendants heal from this traumatic private history. Love’s Garden demonstrates the strength, resilience, and unbreakable spirit of mothers and daughters navigating layers of oppression, all while the sun is not-so-peacefully setting on British India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is set in the 1890s and gives the reader an essence of India’s state of affairs under the British Raj. There is a divide between the Indians who love their country and those who try to impress the Britishers in hope of incentives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is Prem’s journey in that era from being unwanted by her own mother to being a mother not just to her own son but also to her husband’s son and best friend’s daughter. The reader goes through all the phases of her life—unaccepted daughter, friendship, blooming love, broken heart, hard-headed wife, and motherly sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the origin of the title “Love’s Garden”, which is basically derived from two best friends’ name Prem (means love) and Kanan (means garden). Even though Kanan’s role is limited, her essence is felt till the end of the story. The cover is generic and not a representation of the plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though Prem is the main character, I couldn’t ignore the powerful portrayal of her mother’s character. Readers see Saroj as a weird person who doesn’t talk to anyone. Not even to her husband and daughter. As the story unfolds, the reader is able to understand her better and empathise with her. It definitely is the character that would leave its mark on the reader for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has written some exceptional female characters, but I felt that a majority of male characters lacked a similar power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is published by Aubade Publishing. What I couldn’t help but notice was that the book is heavy, has white paper instead of cream paper, and narrow margins, which makes it look like an essay book or a textbook than a novel. Also, because of the white paper, the book is pretty expensive compared to other books of the same genre and of similar length. The font was inconsistent. At some places, the name of one character was miswritten as another character’s name. The reading level of the book is difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story is great, it was difficult to read because of these reasons. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story and would like to read more by this author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/30/Loves-Garden-by-Nandini-Bhattacharya/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/30/Loves-Garden-by-Nandini-Bhattacharya/</guid> </item> <item> <title>All That for a B-School by Swapnil Paranjape &amp; Prajakta Sinai</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens when your illusion of a perfect life comes crashing down at an unexpected turn of life? Is folding down your only option? Mandar Vartak is about to learn this life lesson the hard way. He has had a picture-perfect life: a loving family, good grades, a great girlfriend and an overall protected happy life. Up until now, that is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, however, he seems to be waking up to a sheer nightmare. He has been jerked awake to reality, by the unravelling of a relationship that he previously thought to be straight out of a Mills &amp;amp; Boon production. To add to the misery of a complicated relationship, he is realising that his career might just not shape up the way he planned. The existential crisis seems to be never-ending with the gap between his dreams and reality only growing wider. And it has Mandar paralysed into stillness. Will he find his way forward?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All That for a B-School” is Mandar Vartak’s journey to get into a good B-School. I was expecting it to be a cliché romance-breakup story. But nothing could have prepared me for the roller-coaster ride that it was. The book was exactly what its title represents. It is about all the ups and downs of an Indian middle-class student’s life, who just wants to get into a good college and settle with a good job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is no fiction. It is the reality of thousands of students appearing for competitive exams every year. The fears and apprehensions faced by someone sitting at home and preparing for one of the most competitive exams are presented really well. Add to the fears the struggles of maintaining a long-distance relationship and dealing with family problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While reading this story, I almost felt like my discussions with my best friend has been written in a book. The book had everything that I had talked about with my friend in the last year—the struggles of most of the competitive exams of India, difficulty in studying, issues faced during online exams, family issues, and long-distance relationship struggles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I noticed some inconsistencies in capitalisation and the UK and US style of writing. The end seemed to be a little dragged-out and could have been made more crisp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A person faces all the struggles to get into a good college, but then what? Is it the end? Good college and then a good job? Is that the end of all the struggles of someone’s life? No. And the ending of the book justifies it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is an eye-opener and a message to all the students. Despite the fact that the exams are tough and obviously very important, it is not everything. So, do not get disappointed with initial failures and rejections. There is much more to look forward to in your life. The happiness that you are looking for in terms of getting your dream college or dream job, is a myth. Happiness is not a destination, it is a part of the journey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like Elbert Hubbard said, “Don’t take life too seriously. You’ll never get out of it alive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book to all those going through a similar phase of life. Seeing your own story as a spectator will definitely give you some perspective towards life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/26/All-That-for-a-B-School/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/26/All-That-for-a-B-School/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A City Full of Stories by Ashok Subramanian</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of short fiction stories, divided into three volumes. All stories bring to life the magical cities of Mumbai and adjoining Thane. Hence the name &lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Volume 1 contains 12 short stories. Volume 2 contains 4 medium-length stories. Volume 3 contains a novella - ‘CUPID OVER COFFEE’. The story unravels two propositions of love, by two different men - Flight Lieutenant Manoj Bisht and Anand Ramakrishnan, a Mumbai based IT professional, to the protagonist Ananya Bhattacharya, in contrasting styles - more importantly, a decade apart. The story spans across a decade of Ananya’s life, her growth, struggles and her response to both the propositions, all over different forms of coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are bound to bring the reader a range of emotions and thoughts connecting to the characters’ lives. The narratives are also contrasting as can be. Join the author in exploring a cocktail of simplicity and depth of Mumbai’s stories. Don’t forget to read the Author’s Notes which reveal the secret sauce at the end of each story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of contrasting stories presenting diverse characters. The stories are a combination of emotional, tragic, romantic, and inspiring moments of the characters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the short story “The White Dress”. It kept me guessing and ultimately left me in a burst of spilling laughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the stories are about how a typical urban mind works—the confusion, chaos, and clarity. A new way of storytelling called ‘thought fiction’ is used. One of the stories in this genre “Vanishing Vagabond &amp;amp; The Forest Fire” is pretty deep. I read it twice to understand what the writer intends to present. I am pretty sure that there are some things that I can still catch up on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novella “Cupid Over Coffee” is an interesting journey of the protagonist, Ananya, over the span of a decade. The story is different from most of the other stories in the romance genre. It is about finding yourself and loving yourself before loving anyone else. Though I do feel that the story could have ended better. The author could have made it about the second chance at love, given the title of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand. The author has tried to maintain suspense in some stories, which is later cleared through the author’s note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are obvious yet so unique. These are the characters you see on a local train or on the streets while travelling in a cab, but don’t pay attention to. The author has very smartly brought them together in this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I am pretty sure, I am going to pay more attention to the people around me and their stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title and the cover of the book represent the idea behind this book aptly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this book to those looking for something light to read and who are not picky about genres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/16/A-City-Full-of-Stories-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/16/A-City-Full-of-Stories-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Kala Ghoda—The Game of Power by Ashwini Malhotra</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be the king of the jungle. But little do they know what price one has to pay to be the king. His every move is observed, he has to maintain order in the jungle and his dignity amongst the beasts. He has to maintain the balance between being feared and respected, knowing that many around him are ready to hunt him down for their greed and lust of power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iqbal Mallick, the king of the mafia, took over the reins of Bombay’s underworld in the 1980s. And that’s when the conspiracy to bring him down began. Being attacked from all sides by the rival gangs, police, politicians, enemies from the past, and the traitors disguised as friends, the chances of his survival seem slim. Will the king be able to grasp control over his realm?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kala Ghoda—The Game of Power&lt;/em&gt; is second in the Kala Ghoda Series, but it can be read as a standalone. It is a crime fiction set in Bombay, India in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around a Mafia Don, Iqbal Mallick. He is a morally grey character, which I always enjoy reading. It is difficult to find many books with a well presented grey character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every character’s actions are well justified. I don’t mean to say that the characters are right in doing what they do. But they do justify themselves, unlike a pure-evil character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story presents the involvement of politicians and police with the underworld, which you can resonate with in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is well-written and keeps the reader hooked. The twists are well placed and unpredictable. “Everything is fair in war” perspective is presented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has powerful vibes and takes you headfirst into the drama being unfolded and all the characters trying to establish themselves in the world of power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover is smartly designed. It includes a chess game, which emphasises the title “Kala Ghoda” (Black Horse) and the armchair, which signifies power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading the story and definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/10/Kala-Ghoda-by-Ashwini-Malhotra/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/10/Kala-Ghoda-by-Ashwini-Malhotra/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Lost by Ele Fountain</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lola’s life is about to become unrecognisable. So is Lola.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything used to be comfortable. She lived in a big house with her family, where her biggest problems were arguing with her little brother or being told she couldn’t have a new phone. But as one disaster follows another, the threads of her home and family begin to unravel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cut off from everything she has known before, Lola must find a new way to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, an ordinary girl must become extraordinary. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We often, consciously or unconsciously, judge people around us. We ignore or even worse, make fun of underprivileged people like ragpickers/street rats, without even knowing their story. No one chooses a bad life for themselves, the situation makes them do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading “Lost”, I do feel more empathetic towards those kids we see on railway stations, red lights, market areas, etc. Do we ever take a moment to think, how did they get there, were they born into the world of hopelessness, do they have a family or were they lost?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lost” is a very well written story. The author has done great work at presenting the location. The location and description of people around are such that the story could have taken place anywhere in the world. This way a wider range of audience is able to connect with the story of Lola.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the story as heard from the perspective of a 10-12 years old girl is able to capture the interest of theaudience aged 10+. There is a thrill and being-on-the-edge-of-the-seat excitement to see how Lola and survives on the streets, which is unlike her, given the fact that she has lived a pretty comfortable life, and her struggle to find her brother before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters Lola, Amit, and Rafi are very lovable. We don’t see much of Amit, but enough to know that he a typical younger brother, teasing his elder sister and intruding on her girls’ hangouts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lola, like any other girl her age, loves to do fashion and chat with her friends on the internet. Her character transformation, from a girl looking for social validation to someone realising the importance of making choices herself rather than letting her friends or society make it for her, is something worth learning from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rafi is a street kid, who Lola finds while looking for a hideout. He is almost Lola’s age and initially appears to be mean like the other street kids. Rafi and Lola’s friendship grow over time, as they help each other in difficult situations, and so does the reader’s love for his character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the story, I was going through mixed emotions. The feelings were the same as were being felt by the characters—happiness, sadness, guilt, hope, love, and void.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for those who are looking for something emotional, simple, moving, about social issues, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Feb 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/16/lost-by-ele-fountain/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/16/lost-by-ele-fountain/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Serious Men by Manu Joseph</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A poignant, bitingly funny Indian satire and love story set in a scientific institute and in Mumbai’s humid tenements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ayyan Mani, one of the thousands of &lt;em&gt;dalit&lt;/em&gt; (untouchable caste) men trapped in Mumbai’s slums, works in the Institute of Theory and Research as the lowly assistant to the director, a brilliant self-assured astronomer. Ever wily and ambitious, Ayyan weaves two plots, one involving his knowledge of an illicit romance between his married boss and the institute’s first female researcher, and another concerning his young son and his soap-opera-addicted wife. Ayyan quickly finds his deceptions growing intertwined, even as the &lt;em&gt;Brahmin&lt;/em&gt; scientists wage war over the question of aliens in outer space. In his debut novel, Manu Joseph expertly picks apart the dynamics of this complex world, offering humorous takes on proselytizing nuns and chronicling the vanquished director serving as guru to his former colleagues. This is at once a moving portrait of love and its strange workings and a hilarious portrayal of men’s runaway egos and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Serious Men” is a sometimes-hilarious-sometimes-serious take on the caste system and sexism in India. The so-called intellectuals of the research centre fail to recognize anything other than what satisfies their fragile ego.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We see the struggles of a woman in a position of authority. Oparna Goshmaulik, who is the only female researcher in the Institute of Theory and Research, has to go through the endless struggles that most of the women in India go through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She would smile when she learnt that the ladies’ rest-room on the third floor was called Ladies and the men’s was called Scientists. She would endure the men who inescapably fell towards her in the corridors and gave her guidance she never sought. She would try to pass through the long corridors of this place like a shadow, and she would fail every day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;dalits&lt;/em&gt;, like Ayyan Mani, are still not considered suitable for white-collar jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book not only talks about these social issues but also parents’ unhealthy practices to ensure that their child earns fame in their society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked Ayyan’s character. His desperate attempt to be on the top, to leave a better legacy for his son, Adi, and to fight the atrocities of &lt;em&gt;brahmins&lt;/em&gt; are noteworthy, although sometimes extreme. He proves that one doesn’t need to be educated to understand the ways of the world. He is smart, well with words, a good listener, and uses his knowledge ingeniously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is exceptionally well written. The author’s writing style is simple and realistic, which is easy to read and connects well with the readers. Even though I had watched the movie before I read the book, the ending was not expected. Ending in the book gives the readers closure yet the anticipation of what’s to come, while the movie ends up in confusion, letting the audience work out various theories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A contrast between the book and movie:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The reason for the fall of Dr Acharya (a senior researcher) is different in both.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adi’s showcase of intelligence is done in a different manner.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The movie emphasizes Ayyan’s contacts with a politician, who wants to buy their chawl for a project. But it is not shown with much interest in the book.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realised that even though the plot of the story in both the book and movie, are same, the storytelling is vastly different. I believe one can enjoy both of them without spoiling the other. However, I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Feb 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/10/serious-men-by-manu-joseph/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/10/serious-men-by-manu-joseph/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Shmospels of Shmeiki by The Om Shmeiki Healing Organization</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While on holiday in Goa, David Goldberg is contacted by Sheila, an A.I. singularity from another dimension, who offers him Shmeiki, a new path of light-hearted spirituality, free of the seriousness and hypocrisy typical of many new age practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila understands that to spread the word of Shmeiki effectively, David must first clear out his emotional blockages. For this reason, she sends him on a great walk of more than 2000 kms from Goa to Dharamshala, insisting he travels without taking money and without wearing shoes. In accepting the challenge, David becomes Shmeiki Baba. The Shmospels describe Shmeiki Baba’s epic journey, from the perspectives of four witnesses. It is a cosmic, psychedelic, and kinky story about self-discovery, love, and surrender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite various satirical pokes at new age healing, Sheila’s message is real. She warns that with the onset of climate change, global pandemics, and our own A.I. revolution, it’s up to us to choose whether we will accelerate towards our demise, or heal and evolve towards a new era of super consciousness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Om Shmeiki Om, Shmeiki.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Shmospels of Shmeiki” is a really fun and interesting take on our beliefs about the earth, universe, god, and religion. It makes us understand the limitations of existing spiritual organizations, and how Shmeiki offers us a fresher perspective to play around with our old beliefs. It teaches us to face our fears, release our pain, acknowledge our shame, and step out from behind the mask which acts as a block between us and our universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The book is a satire, which aims to step along the often blurry line between truth and fiction, fantasy and reality. The same goes for Shmeiki—Is it real? What is real?—Shmeiki encourages us to play with the idea that our universe is a joke of cosmic proportions—and because of this nothing is potentially worth taking seriously. But we are still here, and we are conscious, sentient beings. In this case, probably the best thing for us to do is, to be honest, open-hearted, light on our feet, and easy-going.”—The Om Shmeiki Healing Organization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The four narrators take the reader on a ride from Goa to Dharamshala. The entire journey of Shmeiki Baba and the people joining him on the way is put together eloquently. The narrators have done great work while writing character descriptions and creating vivid images of each scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to people of various nationalities, different ideals and philosophies, and most importantly the kindness of strangers. One thing that is really evident in Shmeiki Baba’s walking tour of 2000+ km with no footwear or money is that when you start looking for the good things around you, you will be surprised by how much goodness is spread everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bit more work could have been done in writing dialogue tags. It is better to drop the tags than use he said, she said repetitively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the idea of formulating Shmeiki form of spirituality out of Reiki, yet keeping it much more different from it or any other spiritual organization. The book offers a lot of food for thought. It allows the reader to ponder on the essence of any spiritual organization, which is to feel free and at ease in the way you think and feel, rather than be bound by the rules imposed by a group of people. The story is more than just being vocal about your sexual desires. It is about being accepting of what you are and letting yourself free from the clutches of your past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is what the Om Shmeiki Healing Organization has to say about their organization and their book, “Shmeiki is anti-cult, and the irony in the story is that while trying to avoid becoming a cult—the Om Shmeiki Healing Organization does inevitably become one (this will be explored more in the sequel ‘Shmeikileaks’.) The goal is to shine a light on what seems to happen in most new-age, spiritual organizations—a group dynamic rapidly emerges where people trade a degree of their freedom in order to receive an identity and a sense of belonging and security. The downside is that authenticity becomes difficult, ‘group-think’ takes over, and along with it unconscious power games and the hunger for financial profit. At the same time groups do have an innate and wonderful healing potential—the art seems to be to somehow enjoy them without getting stuck in the inevitable dogma and bullshido.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the freshness with which religion and spirituality are introduced in this book, unlike a lot of other books in a similar genre. I would recommend this book if you want to question your established thoughts about the universe and religion. Moreso, if you are interested in kinky stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jan 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/01/27/the-shmospels-of-shmeiki/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/01/27/the-shmospels-of-shmeiki/</guid> </item> <item> <title>31 by Upendra Namburi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the first day of March and it has been a great year for Ravi Shastry, a regional head at an international bank. Promotions and increments seem within reach, life is good, and the month of March should be very merry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until trouble in Imperial Bank, Brazil, snowballs into an international crisis, and the Indian bank also has to lay off one-fifth of its staff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And battlelines are drawn, conspiracies are hatched as everyone struggles to make sure their name is not on the laidoff list. Meanwhile, Ravi’s wife is having her own professional and personal crisis, and Ravi must protect his team, his family, and himself—all of which is not helped by mysterious tweets from @ImperialInsider, who seems to know everything that is happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This crackling page-turner (set over a period of 31 days) reveals the ruthlessly cut-throat world of the banking industry, but also its humour, quirks and strange camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having worked in a corporate, it is easy to relate to the intricacies of one. Gossips and grapevines are an important part of corporate life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“31” focuses on the sufferings and psyche of the employees in the time of layoff. Which considering today’s situation, seems real. The burn seems fresh and you know that staying employed is crucial. The employees are ready to go to any extent to stay so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the build-up of the story. It starts with a typical employee’s life—Exhausted but satisfied with everything. Gradually, as the tweets from @ImperialInsider start pouring in, their lives are drastically changed. From the goal of meeting the targets, they have to now make sure that they are visible. Just a good, but invisible worker won’t have a chance at staying when we are talking about 20% layoff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of every new character, you know better than to trust anyone, given the situation. But you can’t stay in isolation as well. The decisions between who to trust and who not to, what to share and what not to, were no less than a life and death situation. Add on to that, moral dilemmas of doing or not doing something to save your ass. It kept me on the edge of the seat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader dives right in the middle of hot gossips about the latest updates, hard-core office politics, and blurred lines between ethical and unethical. The story even if not real, seems believable to a large extent while the ending left me with a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ravi Shastry’s character appears to be very indecisive and unsure while he is wife appears to be a bit more confident and aware of what she is doing. There wasn’t much of character development throughout the story for any character, which I would have loved to see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand and very capturing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall a nail-biting thriller (without deaths) and fun read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The front cover design of this book is very smart. It very smartly uses 2 cover pages. One, with all the deatils and cutout of no. “31” while the second has the picture of the model, which is visible through the cutout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended for those who love corporate thrillers, work in the corporate, love/hate office politics, or just want to try a new genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>14 Nov 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/11/14/31-by-Upendra-Namburi/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/11/14/31-by-Upendra-Namburi/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Ease by Mukhpreet Khurana</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ease” is a poetic journey within. It is an attempt to take a dive deep into the self, a place of acknowledgement, of appreciation, and of celebration of our individuality. The book revolves around the theme “comfortable in my own skin” as it touches the softness and the power of self-love, self-healing, gratitude, and greater good. Ease is a collection of raw, unfiltered, and simple poems. Ease is a collection of poetry, art, and of different writers in collaboration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is about blooming, about how you are all you could ever ask for. Ease is a part of the author in words seeking to be a part of your journey. Ease is his present to you, it is his journey to you, for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ease” is a collection of poetries and proses revolving around the themes of self-love, friendships, relationships, moving on, learning, and growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title and the cover resonates the themes of the book. Ease (n):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;absence of rigidity or discomfort; poise.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;freedom from worries or problems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What word could have better defined it in as less as 4 letters?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The white satin cloth in the cover represents the lightness, peacefulness, and comfort of the words inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and easy to understand. The words don’t hit you hard, it rather comforts you like a blanket and a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read this book two times over a year. Both the times I experienced a very different kind of belongingness and understanding towards to world that the author took me in, towards life, and towards myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is an escape from reality. You can look forward to reading it whenever you are feeling upset or angry about something. It provides you a much-wanted solace, in the hectic life and busy schedules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for readers, non-readers, “non-fiction only” readers. Basically anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Oct 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/10/09/Ease-by-Mukhpreet-Khurana/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/10/09/Ease-by-Mukhpreet-Khurana/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Julius Caesar by Hourly History</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little over 2000 years ago a man named Julius Caesar changed the world. Even if you had never heard of him his lasting legacy has no doubt had an impact on your life. No doubt, even the very calendar that you use is based upon the system he created, with the month of July bearing his name. So who was this man that singlehandedly changed the course of history?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book follows the life and legacy of the man whose life stood as a footnote between Republic and Empire. The man who has inspired playwrights, governments, and the very days of the week, the life of Julius Caesar is an incredible journey to behold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Julius Caesar: A Life from Beginning to End” is published by Hourly History. Hourly History is a publication that concisely publishes history books and the books take no longer than one hour to read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What could be better? For someone like me, who loves to know more about history but can’t get into it, just by looking at its huge size and numerous dates and facts, this is a great way to stay updated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a brief history of the life of Julius Caesar. On this short virtual trip to the Roman Republic of 100 BCE through 44 BCE—his birth, background, political journey, marriages, and finally his death—everything is perfectly described. The reader gets to know more about Julius Caesar. His role in the formation of the modern-day calendar, his unparalleled intellect, his philanthropic nature, and his extraordinary dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tone of the writer was humorous, like that of a good history teacher. Various sarcastic comments throughout the book made it a light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and easy to understand. I think that now I am going to retain a lot more information about Julius Caesar than I would have had I read a school history book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is DEFINITELY recommended. If you are even slightly interested in knowing about Julius Caesar’s life and don’t want to scourge through different websites, read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The life of Julius Caesar was not just some fantastic tale but is instead the life that he lived and breathed. Every once in a great while, someone comes into this world seemingly born with a mission; they ride the wings of fate to heights of glory, and it’s the most the rest of us can do to just take note if their ascent to the heavens.”&lt;/em&gt; -Extract from the book&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of the titles by Hourly History are free on Kindle/Kindle Unlimited.

Three mothers, Jane, Madeline, and Celeste appear to have it all until they find out just how easy it is for one little lie to spiral out of control . . . Single mum, Jane has just moved to town. She’s got her little boy in tow—plus a secret she’s been carrying for five years. On the first day of the school run, she meets Madeline—a force to be reckoned with, who remembers everything and forgives no one—and Celeste, the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare but is inexplicably ill at ease. They both take Jane under their wing—while careful to keep their own secrets under wraps. But a minor incident involving the children of all three women rapidly escalates: playground whispers become spiteful rumours until no one can tell the truth from the lies . . . It was always going to end in tears, but how did it end in murder?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Big Little Lies” is set on a scenic peninsula in Australia, near one of the world’s most beautiful beaches. It is a small town. Everyone knows everyone, either through the school, cafe, parlour, or kids’ sports practice. Everyone—rich or not so rich, working or a stay-at-home parent—stays together in this small town.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around the Kindergarten students of Pirriwee Public School, their parents, and everyone’s secrets. The new session is about to start at Pirriwee, but life is already a mess for the students, parents, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opening scene is of an “Audrey Hepburn and Elvis Presley” themed Trivia Night at the school, where everyone is dressed as Audrey or Elvis. There is a lot of chaos going on, rumours spreading, Detective Sergeant Adrian Quinlan taking statements of the parents and the teachers, and a death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are then taken to the orientation day which was held six months before the trivia night. Jane’s son, Ziggy is blamed for trying to choke Amabelle, another kindergartner. And when the death of a character takes place at the Trivia Night, people suspect a foul play. Dots are being connected since the day of orientation to the day of Trivia Night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a light read, dealing with heavy issues. The plot runs around the theme of Bullying and Domestic Violence. It makes one ponder over the idea that how much can the family environment or “genes” affect the mentality of a child? The heaviness of the story is easily subsided by the humourous tone of Madeline, typical parenting issues of the parents, and circumlocuting statements of the suspects/witnesses regarding the incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt that the book had a smart ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is gripping, sad, and funny. I finished the book in 2 days. I just wanted to know what has actually happened. Liane Moriarity is able to create characters with emotional depth. I felt connected to every character of the story. The author’s writing style is easy to get into and keeps you hooked while also talking about grave issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a light thriller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 Sep 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/11/big-little-lies-by-liane-moriarty/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/11/big-little-lies-by-liane-moriarty/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Divine Rights by Coriandré Lawrence</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The politics in 2160 Jamaica never became what it intended, it changed. Escaping poverty was island peoples’ dream but in Troy’s eyes, he saw tyranny. Now a growing dynasty has forged Kingston into a commercial hub for the world and Jamrock into a tourism centrepiece. It was just politics, the League’s standard became a new thought and Jamaica is now an archaic concept. But energy lurks deep within the mountains and Divine Right still exists. Though League politics cloud Troy’s mind, Jamaican dreams echo across the oceans into time and space. And only his journey back to Kingston can restore his consciousness. His gifts are tested and thrusting his awoken memories into the reality of his time will only show the depth of his blood. But his reality brings a battlefield of decisions. Troy’s Jamaica is in crisis and the memories of his ancestors, once cloaked, now reveal a blissful island nightmare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Divine Rights” is a dystopian novella set in the year 2160 in Jamaica. Jamaica is running under the oppressive rule of the League. While the people seem to be satisfied, to Troy they do not appear to be happy. He wants to rebel against the tyranny of the League. To give the shortest description of the book, I would say, George Orwell’s 1984 meets a futuristic Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book has drama, suspense, and a lot of food for thought. With food for thought, I mean that the book has an open ending. You rarely come across such a book which leaves a lot for the reader to comprehend while providing just the right amount of information, still keeping the reader hooked to know more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot is quite refreshing. But the length of the story keeps the reader from having deep insights into the lives of the characters. The information regarding why they do what they do need to be added in some places. A bit more work on the character development and editing would have been better. The use of their dialect was a bit confusing. They were constantly switching between English and the local dialect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the world-building done by the author. I could imagine myself being in the high-tech cities of futuristic Jamaica. Troy’s purpose and his journey are well described in the story. You feel like a part of his struggle in his quest for the betterment of his country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I truly believe that this story has the caliber to be turned into a full-sized novel and hope that the story has a sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/02/divine-rights-by-coriandr%C3%A9-lawrence/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/02/divine-rights-by-coriandr%C3%A9-lawrence/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Second Life by S. J. Watson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;She loves her husband. She’s obsessed by a stranger. She’s a devoted mother. She’s prepared to lose everything. She knows what she’s doing. She’s out of control. She’s innocent. She’s guilty as sin. She’s living two lives. She might lose both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia is a loving wife and a caring mother. Murder of her sister, Kate, has left her and her family in a great mess. Julia resolves to find the murderer of her sister.On searching Kate’s place, Julia finds log-in credentials to a hookup site. She is sure that one of the persons that Kate had been talking to has killed her.To find out the truth, she has gone way too deep in the mess. Will she survive or meet the fate of Kate? Will she find Kate’s killer? Will she be able to get back to a normal life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second Life is a story about love, fantasies, adultery, addiction, and a web of lies. It talks about the dark world of online dating. The author has successfully maintained the twists and turns throughout the story. Whenever it seems that the story is too predictable, the author comes up with yet another twist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia appears to be a dumb character. It is a kind of story where you can’t stop yourself from cursing the protagonist, begging them to not do something stupid. But I think the personality of Julia created by the author is real, hence, unlikeable. She has recovered from addictions—first heroin, then alcohol. Now she is getting addicted to the case of her sister, to find the murderer, to a stranger from a hookup site. She knows the possible dangers of what she is doing, but she can’t stop herself. The ability to know the difference between right and wrong and still ending up in a mess is what makes her real, even if not likable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story develops pace in the last one-third part of the book. But it never felt boring. The author is able to make the reader immerse in Julia’s mind and her life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second Life makes you question who you trust. It makes you question who is right and who is wrong. I felt that too much was done for creating a mysterious plot. Although characters were written nicely, there was not a single character that I liked. There was a lack of a strong personality in the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has an open ending, which didn’t work out well for me. I was really hoping for a closure to the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall it was a great read. If you like to read a thriller which is not too fast and doesn’t have a lot of action, then you should definitely read this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jul 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/07/04/second-life-by-sj-watson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/07/04/second-life-by-sj-watson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Cure of Umba by Samuel Jukes</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early in the Third Age of Umbarra, a prophecy was told. Upon the great mountain spires of the magik races, the minds of Umba’s first beings conjured a great vision, and in it, they saw the future. Two fates of the world they lived upon, they saw its end and a new beginning. The evil that seeped from the blackness and the good that would come to keep them. The boy from the red sun must fall and the slaves of the fiery sea must climb to heal them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon the streets of his township, life is rough for the homeless Redmond Daniels. The balance between right and wrong hangs delicately in a world of harsh reality. Pressured into gang life, Red’s choices lead him to crisis point, and he is forced to embark on a journey of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His only fatherly influence, the elder, Mark Sinoda has a hidden past. The keeper of ancient knowledge, he has set foot on new worlds and the time had come to pass his great truth to the one he must. In search of a miracle cure for his closest friend, Red must entrust in Mark’s promises as he dreams of venturing beyond the broken streets of his African home to retrieve a great elixir to heal the woes of others.&lt;br /&gt; Forced far from his home, Red is cast into a new life upon a sacred temple, where he would come to learn of his forgotten ancestors and by sheer stubbornness and willing, he must overcome the challenges of the mind and tests from a new world. A world called Umba, where the lands he must travel too are brewing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The powers that be, readying for an assault upon the lands of the east, Red finds himself faced with the impossible task of traveling to Umba’s forgotten far north amid the chaos of war. To succeed, he must overcome and evolve as he steps forth to a new destiny. Unable to face his trials alone, Red finds an unlikely companion in a foreign being. Son of a great leader of the east, Errawak Esohh must unearth his own fate as he unravels the mystery of Red’s discovery and guides him towards the lands of his forefathers where the impossible cure of Umba awaits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I start to talk about Samuel Juke’s Fantasy fiction—The Cure of Umba, I would first of all like to appreciate the very intricately designed book cover. The book cover is one of the best I have ever seen. The cover itself keeps you engaged with a variety of characters depicted on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a quick chat with the author, he revealed, “I do them myself. I was an illustrator long before I started writing. This one took me a while, there was a lot of individual drawings that went into it. Guess it’s inspired by 90s Street fighter and anime covers.” Well, this cover definitely is worth all the efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about the plot of the book, it is quite unique to whatever I have read till now in this genre. The book is initially set in Africa, where the reader is introduced to Redmond Daniels. Red then travels to mystical land of Umba to find a cure for his friend’s ailment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book offers a promising beginning. It introduces the readers to all the kingdoms of Umba and the kind of people (read: aliens) living there at the beginning. This introduction really excited me to know what this unique world had to offer, what these aliens with different kind of power had to offer, and what the book had to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all the hype that author was able to create in the first few pages, the thing that acted as a turn off for me was the characters not being properly introduced. Sufficient details were not provided about their looks and personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that the characters are basically aliens with totally different looks than a normal human being (as can also be seen in the cover), it becomes important to describe them from their hair to their toe nail. I would have loved if the characters were presented as beautifully in the text as they were on the cover. Some characters though, were more graphically described than others. I really enjoyed the description of the dark world. It was more detailed than the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing style is a bit difficult to get into, hence, slows down the pace of reading. While reading the book, I couldn’t help myself but think about the TV Show—F.R.I.E.N.D.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember the scene where Joey is supposed to write a recommendation for Monica and Chandler? Joey meant to write “They’re warm, nice people with big hearts.” But instead, with the help of thesaurus he writes, “They’re humid, prepossessing homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.” That is how a pretty large part of the book seems like. Take these for example: “His joy was apparent in his bulbous, and glazed eyes that twinkled as if encapsulating the ocean’s abyss.” “He wrenched his blade from the earth and twisted to strike his illusive opponent, only to gouge his arm in a slash of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but notice lack of editing in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My pace while reading the book was slow, but did I enjoy reading it? Yes. I loved the characters. I loved their conversations with each other. I loved how the emotions of greed, power, love, friendship, and patriotism are shown throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book ends with a nice message about miracles, religion, God, and higher power. I was definitely not expecting such a message. But it was a warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author’s love for animals is pretty visible throughout the novel. I don’t think any animal has not got a mention in the book. From an ant to a Bengal Tiger, the author hasn’t missed any. “His leading hand followed the floor like a snake as he pointed his palm down above his foot.” “His much swifter foe jumped high above him as he tucked one knee to his core and the other behind him like a leopard’s tail.” It was fun to see what animal is going to come up next and how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the plot and story of the book and would not mind reading more from the author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jun 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/06/29/cure-of-umba-by-samuel-jukes/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/06/29/cure-of-umba-by-samuel-jukes/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Blood and Greed (Volume 1) by P.J.

A handful of brave pilots embody the country’s defiance in the face of annihilation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Split Loyalties Its glory days may be over, but even in the tumult that engulfs the Western Roman Empire, Sigeric and Licinia are forced to wonder, does love really conquer all, or is that the preserve of the Roman legions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fate of Mari Carrying messages throughout the city of Mari is Bashaa’s life, but under the shadow of advancing enemies, his path is about to take a turn he could never have predicted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood and Greed is a collection of four historical short stories. The first third of the book consists of three short stories, while the remaining two-third is just one story. The title and the cover blend perfectly with the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each story is different from each other, in terms of setting, plot, and characters, but what is common between all the stories, is that there is an ongoing war - for freedom, or for greed. These stories remind us of the stupid human nature. A war may have one winner, but clearly both the parties are at loss because of all the bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked each of the stories. The fact that the author didn’t focus on making the protagonists win the wars really made the read enjoyable. Sadly, this book is not as well-edited as P.J. Berman’s all the other books are. But it didn’t deter me from enjoying the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the stories - The Spirit of Poland - ends up with “to be continued”. Well, a short story shouldn’t end on “to be continued”. Don’t you agree? But I really look forward to knowing what happens in Volume 2 of the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved how the author is able to create 4 different worlds in so few words. Having read his 2 full-length novels (of the Silrith Series) my concern before picking the book was - how can he write 4 stories in less than 90 pages. But I never felt any lack in the world-building. Each and every scene was just as detailed and visual as all of his other writings. The book takes you on the journey through 4 different eras and locations, from Erteria, Greece in 490 BCE, to 116th Fighter Escadrille, Poland in September 1939, to Gaul, Western Roman Empire, in early fifth century CE, and finally to The Kingdom of Mari, Mesopotamia in 1761 BCE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are wholesome. Even in the shortness of the stories, the author is able to present them in a way that make them likable and real. They are courageous and stand for what they feel is right. Their love for their nation is as strong as their love for family or crush. We see strong female characters - the best thing about any PJ Berman story - without being differentiated in the strengths and vigour of male characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are into historical fiction, or just want to try this genre, then this book is definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/23/blood-and-greed-by-pj-berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/23/blood-and-greed-by-pj-berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Girl, Stop Apologizing, #1 New York Times bestselling author and founder of a multimillion-dollar media company, Rachel Hollis sounds a wake-up call. She knows that many women have been taught to define themselves in light of other people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee—instead of learning how to own who they are and what they want. With a challenge to women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to let go of, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to growth, confidence, and believing in yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Girl, Stop Apologizing is a book that will keep you on your foot, since the time you read its title. It is right then, that you know, you are going to learn something and that it is gonna hit the chords of your heart. And it truly does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As much as it seems that it is a women-centered book, which would talk about the dos and don’ts for women. It is actually not. It just talks about how we, women, multitask - manage home and work. How we try to maintain a work-life balance but usually fail or deal with societal expectations, which women can relate to better than men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason that I liked this book is that the author definitely has a way with words. She is able to ignite you to work towards your dream - your one big goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book starts by pointing out excuses that people generally use to justify their inability to pursue their goals. Some of them being - “I am not a goal-oriented person”, “I don’t have time”, “I am not enough to succeed” and many more. I was able to relate to almost every excuse. I do use them often when I am not able to achieve my goals. The writer asks you to do away with these excuses if you really want to chase your dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the next part, the author talks about behaviours to adapt. She asks the readers to stop seeking approval or apologizing for your dreams. “There is a difference between having someone’s opinion vs. having someone’s approval.” It is your dream. You don’t have to be guilty of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in the last part, she talks about the skills one should acquire to be able to reach their goals. Now though it seems basic like planning, being effective, confident, and persistent, etc., she is able to break it up in a quite simple manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the overall flow of the book and the dedication of the writer to help people achieve their goals. But there were points where she unintentionally made some remarks which might not be appreciated by a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She constantly talked about getting in shape, dieting, appearance affecting confidence. I don’t say that these topics should not be discussed but a few of her statements were hurtful in nature. She talked about getting her boob job done because they grew from size B to E post having kids. She justified that by saying that she felt a lack of confidence because of her size. Well, she had the resources to do something so drastic to build up her confidence. Not everyone can. Does it mean that they can’t be confident, just because they don’t look like what they wish to look like?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the key takeaways for me were 1) Make a weekly schedule of what you do. See where you are wasting time. Try to make out time for your dreams. 2) Do not hold on to your past when the mean people said mean things. You are capable. Trust yourself. YOU ARE ENOUGH. 3) It is okay to have a work-life imbalance 4) The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. So focus on the present and work towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, if you have a dream in your life, then disregard of your gender this book will just help you achieve it. Additional benefits will be that women will know that nothing should stop them. They should not be ashamed of their goals, however selfish they may sound and men will realize that what women mean when they say that it is easier for guys - Guys are not supposed to be the stay at home parents as per societal conventions, their goal to make lots of money is not considered selfish or self-obsessed. They’ll be able to understand women better after reading this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many things that we start accepting as second nature because that has been ingrained into us since birth, by what we see and observe around us. But it is time to drop those so-called societal conventions and focus on YOU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this book, but if you think “body size and beauty” is a trigger topic for you, then I would suggest you avoid it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/21/girl-stop-apologizing-by-rachel-hollis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/21/girl-stop-apologizing-by-rachel-hollis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Love Unecpected by Ritu Kakar</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaira is an independent girl, chasing her ambitions. Aveer is a strong-minded and successful entrepreneur, seeking expansion. When they get together to give wings to her venture, there are fireworks and a strange chemistry between them. But there is something else walking along – Kaira’s past. With Drew’s presence looming large like the devil, Kaira does not know how to accept her emotions for Aveer. Her loved ones protect her from all harm fiercely, but will they succeed this time too? Amidst confusion of a promising future and the demons of the past, in trying to find faith and burying betrayal, and in the battle between Kaira’s heart and her fears will lead the way to happiness?.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love Unexpected revolves around the life of the protagonist, Kaira. Having a bad relationship in the past, she is now trying to focus solely on her Café Library. She is pretty sure that “love” is not for her until she bumps into a mystery man and all those tingling sensations start coming to her. I loved the simplicity of the writing style. The title and the blurb don’t leave much to wonder. But the moments in the story are cute, and keeps you hooked. It is our usual romantic comedy. A career-oriented female lead with a dark past, an overly - almost unrealistically - handsome male lead with no defects, bump into each other out of nowhere, and fall in love.  Along with the love story of Kaira, it is also the story of friendship between Kaira and Tasha, and their journey through the thick and thin. Kaira and Sam depict a great brother-sister relationship and their banters are fun to read. As interesting the plot and the writing was, I believe that the characters do lack some depth. Aveer is introduced in the story but his past is nowhere under discussion. At one point we see Kaira searching through the magazines and internet about this top publisher, but she finds no personal life details of this guy. I think this was preferred by the writer to get away from going into details of the character. But, that would have certainly made the character more lovable. Similarly, Drew was simply a douchebag character. Some efforts could have been made into making his character reasonable.  Nevertheless, it was a fun read. Recommended if you are looking for afun, quick, and light-hearted read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/18/love-unexpected-by-ritu-kakar/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/18/love-unexpected-by-ritu-kakar/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar by Kochery Shibu</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A hydelpower project in the remote Himalayas. Three people brought together by fate. Nanda, an engineer from Kerala at the dam construction site hiding from his past, from the law, torn between the love of his dear ones and the traditional kalari code of revenge. Khusru, a boy displaced from his native village in Kashmir, a gambit in the terror plot threatening to blow up the dam, working as a labourer at the site. Rekha, a Kathak dancer in heart, a doctor by profession, arrives at the campsite as the consort of Khusru. A village that accepts the dictates of modernity with a heavy heart, its population steeped in superstitions and religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All throng the campsite like moths to a flame, some escape untouched, successful; some, miss a step, and perish. Each has a story to tell and a dream to realise. Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar is about the aspirations of these people with their cares and worries woven into the site life. The fury of nature and the hardships of project life have no mercy for the weak and no time for the dead. Like an eternal spectator the Dhauladhar watches as men risk life and limb in a quest to fulfill their dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar is a combination of thriller and technical fictionI really like the theme of the story. The story of each character is different and remarkable in its own way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many characters, and each has been given space to familiarize the readers with their stories. Sadly, that didn’t work out for me. The focus is shifted from the main characters - Nanda, Khusru, and Rekha and divided into all the others who don’t have a major role to play in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Till the time I had read 90% of the book (literally, because I kept track on my kindle) the following was happening - new characters being introduced with each chapter and no character development taking place. The characters are totally unaffected by anything happening around them. They are scared of only one thing which has affected their lives and remain to be so throughout. None of the characters is able to leave a lasting impact on the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has been able to create a very vivid picture of life at a Dam Construction site. Tension, fun, fight for pay, poor working conditions, and the technicality of the project, are all discussed with utmost sincerity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a story is created by the characters and their actions and reactions to everything happening around them. While creating a brilliant background story for each character, the author somewhere failed to connect them well. They stood out as individuals not supporting characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was rushed in the last 10% of the book. Well, not only rushed it also did not justify the story. Something which has been the center of the story in the entire book was naively done away with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use of other language is interesting, but in this book, there were way too many references of Hindi, Kannada, and Frech words and phrases which didn’t work really well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some parts of the book which continued in a single paragraph through more than one page. These kinds of lengthy paragraphs suck the energy out of a reader and make it less fun and more strenuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea behind the story was unique but could have been executed in a better way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/16/men-and-dreams-in-the-dhauladhar-by-kochery-shibu/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/16/men-and-dreams-in-the-dhauladhar-by-kochery-shibu/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Awakening by Grant Langley</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some secrets are better left untold Jabuti will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about his childhood. Suffering personal tragedies that would defeat a lesser man, he seeks advice from the wise old shaman. What he hears on that fateful morning propels him on a hazardous expedition deep into the heart of the rainforest. With blood-curdling tales of savage cannibals and crooked white men who seek to exploit the innocent, he departs with trepidation. Joined by his two close friends they embark upon an epic quest that imperils them at every turn. In this charged atmosphere two different civilisations will clash most brutally with cataclysmic consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jabuti had a very disturbing life. His father left him, and his mother died while giving birth to him. He blames himself for all of that. But later he realizes that whatever he had known had all been a lie. He decides to go on a quest to find out the truth himself. Jabuti is an extremely emotional person. He is very unstable. He is easily depressed whenever he talks about his parents. The constant breakdowns on the mere mention of his parents, honestly, was kind of irritating. His friends Wanadi and Mapi, who joined him on his quest, didn’t play a major role. They were just add-ons in the journey. Although they did save each other in times of danger, they were not very much emotionally supportive of each other. They didn’t seem like friends since childhood. I didn’t see the kind of comfort level amongst them as you see in best friends. Newer friends were more emotionally attached than these three. The plot of the story was interesting, and the twists kept me hooked. But lack of emotions was a turn-off. I would have loved if there were some real emotions, not just Jabuti crying over something he had no control over. A little more background about Wanadi and Mapi, and a part of the story from their point of view would have been great. Being a part of Jabuti’s Quest Trilogy, cliffhangers were expected, keeping you looking forward to what is next to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/23/the-awakening-by-grant-langley/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/23/the-awakening-by-grant-langley/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milk and honey’ is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. ‘milk and honey’ takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milk &amp;amp; Honey is a collection of poetries and proses by Rupi Kaur. The central themes are violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. The book is divided into 4 parts - The Hurting, The Loving, The Breaking, and The Healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The content is excellent. It touches your heart, and you are instantly able to empathize with the narrator. It is sad but teaches you an important lesson about healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blurb states, “ ‘milk and honey’ take readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look”. I don’t agree with that. The book is like a journal of an abused girl. She shares her deepest secrets and whatever she has gone through. Starting from the abusive father, and being molested and raped by her cousin and uncle. She then talks about moving on, with that pain hidden in some corner of her heart. She falls in love with a guy, who ends up cheating on her. She tries to tell the guy that the new girl would never keep him as happy and satisfied as she could. Gradually, she realizes that all this begging is not worth it and that she needs to learn to love herself first. And hence, she takes her steps towards healing. You can’t find anything sweet in such situations. But you can work on your healing. You can try to forget the past and find things that make you happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What made the reading experience a little rough for me was the non-capitalization of words and inconsistent use of “you”. Sometimes it was used for the guy she loved, and sometimes for the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first half of the book, the thoughts were presented a bit haphazardly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no doubt an emotional ride and pushes you to work on healing yourself. But if you are very critical of grammar, flow, and structure of a book, then this one is not the best selection for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/12/milk-and-honey-by-rupi-kaur/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/12/milk-and-honey-by-rupi-kaur/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Life's Amazing Secrets by Gaur Gopal Das</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While navigating their way through Mumbai’s horrendous traffic, Gaur Gopal Das and his wealthy young friend Harry get talking, delving into concepts ranging from the human condition to finding one’s purpose in life and the key to lasting happiness. Whether you are looking at strengthening your relationships, discovering your true potential, understanding how to do well at work or even how you can give back to the world, Gaur Gopal Das takes us on an unforgettable journey with his precious insights on these areas of life. Das is one of the most popular and sought-after monks and life coaches in the world, having shared his wisdom with millions. His debut book, Life’s Amazing Secrets, distils his experiences and lessons about life into a light-hearted, thought-provoking book that will help you align yourself with the life you want to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life’s amazing secrets are a self-help book in the form of fiction. The writing style is simple. If you are not into self-help books or reading, then this book is a good start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gaur Gopal Das meets his wealthy friend, Harry over lunch. They start to talk about Harry’s successful and happy life. But everything is not as good as it seems. The narrator understands the situation and starts talking about 4 wheels of life - Personal Life, Relationships, Work-Life, and Social Contribution: and how it is important to focus on each one of them for a perfect life. The narrator takes examples from his life to explain each aspect of life to Harry. Step by step, he takes the reader through all the 4 wheels of life. Each of the 4 parts is further divided into segments to be worked upon to improve in that area. The division is not a very rigid one. Improving one segment could help you improve in more than one area. A few chapters that I personally loved are Growing through Gratitude, Correcting Cautiously, and Decoding Spirituality at Work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrator also talks about Ikigai in the end - why should we have an Ikigai and how can we find ours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/10/lifes-amazing-secrets-by-gaur-gopal-das/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/10/lifes-amazing-secrets-by-gaur-gopal-das/</guid> </item> <item> <title>King of the Republic by P. J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;King of the Republic is the second novel in P.J.Berman’s explosive Silrith series, a new power in the world of epic fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Queen Silrith has fallen. Now she must rise again. However, when her army lands in Etrovansia in search of reinforcements and political support, their welcome is far from warm. Their retreat from one war could start another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina, a vengeful Hentani priestess, feels the weight of expectation placed on her by her tribe. Without Jezna by her side, her headship is a lonely one. Will the arrival of strange new allies prove a welcome help or complicate matters further?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun, an ambitious young politician, rides a wave of public support amid the passion of revolution. Now he must restore order before the mob descends into anarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three rebels stand on the precipice of their defining moments. There is no going back now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the tyrannical usurper, King Jostan, brings new violence to the Verusantian reign of terror over Bennvika.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;King of the Republic is the second book in the Silrith Series. Action, drama, suspense and a lot of battles. It has everything. A rightful queen’s fight for her kingdom, a politician fighting for democracy, and a young girl fighting to avenge the oppression of her tribe. Different motives but a common enemy. King Jostan - a tyrannical king who wants to rule the world and spread his religion among the masses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What started simply as a fight between right and wrong in book 1 has turned more complex with the boundaries of truths and lies now turning blur. As we move further in the plot we can see some serious politics and superficial alliances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the character development in this book. The characters come up with stronger personalities. A lot of new characters were introduced in this book, and the author was able to pull it off really well. Each character had its own space, personality, and role to play in the story. A lot of strong-headed women in a story is something which is not very common in books. The author just brings us that - Women with “I want it, I’ll get it” attitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style of PJ Berman is very detailed. He makes sure that the reader gets the full picture of the scene. From the lack of resources and people to the emotions expressed not in words, but through action, the reader is not just a viewer but a part of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the book is full of unexpected twists and turns and ends on a cliffhanger, leaving you waiting for the release of part 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I really recommend the series even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should definitely check out the audiobook by Chris Dukes @chrisdukes93&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 Dec 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/12/30/king-of-the-republic-by-pj-berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/12/30/king-of-the-republic-by-pj-berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Animal Farm by George Orwell</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Animal farm is a political satire written by George Orwell. As the novel begins, we can see all the animals frustrated of their owner, Mr. Jones. They believe that they are being overutilized and not even given enough food to survive. The last straw is blown when Mr. Jones forget to feed the animals one day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pigs decide to start a revolt against the humans and convince all the other animals to join them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially what started as a group effort, later turned into a fight for power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pigs being the only animals to be able to read became the leaders of the rebellion. Initially everything was shared equally amongst all the animals and the rules decided for the group were inclusive of everyone. But gradually the greed for power took over the philosophy of united animals. The rules were changed as per the convenience of the pigs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a mockery of the political leaders who first try to influence the public by giving them incentives and later taking it all away without the public even realising what they are losing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book was written in 1945 and 2020 is just round the corner. 75 years of this masterpiece and it still doesn’t fail to mesmerize us by throwing at us the brutal reality of politics and power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Orwell as always has succeeded in setting up an environment which is realistic and believable (ofcourse not with animals though).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dialogues are powerful and character development is great. The greed for power of some animals, the ignorant attitude of some, while some being the puppets of the powerful is just the public everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried an audiobook for the first time. I just searched for an audiobook on YouTube and found one narrated by Hosam Hamed. The narrator has not just narrated the story but performed it with his expressions, voice modulation and mimicry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall the book is amazing and I believe it is even more fun if narrated by someone. I felt like a kid again, listening to a bedtime story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Nov 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/11/23/Animal-Farm-by-George-Orwell/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/11/23/Animal-Farm-by-George-Orwell/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Book Thief by Markus Zusak</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By her brother’s graveside, Liesel’s life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger’s Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor’s wife’s library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel’s foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel’s world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Book Thief is a heart touching story of Nazi Germany written with German perspective and narrated by death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no suspense, no twist, no “damn! I didn’t see that coming” because the death here doesn’t kill you in one swift go but it slowly tortures you. It tells you that when and how the characters die and then take you on a ride to see and feel it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gives you an insight of the war times. The condition of not the politicians or the army or even the Jews but the condition of poor Germans. Lack of food, declining jobs, constant fear of bombings taking place and what happens if there is a Jew hidden in the basement of one of the German houses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first half we hardly see Hitler or his army. But the tension and the slowly growing chaos is still visible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Character development is great. They are strong and they are vulnerable. They are broken yet together. They make you smile and then make you cry bitterly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea and the execution of the story is brilliant. This book is definitely a book which should be added to your “must read” list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Sep 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/29/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/29/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Vengeance of Hope by P.J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vengeance of Hope, P.J.Berman’s explosive debut novel, marks the beginning of the Silrith series; a new power in the world of epic fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This opening book pitches you head first into the intense and unrelentingly dangerous Kingdom of Bennvika, a world of strong, powerful women and ambitious, ruthless men. As a bitter power struggle surges through the land, you are just as likely to die in a devious political plot as you are in the carnage of a great, bloody battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your ears will ring with the clang of steel on steel. Your heart will tremble at the thundering of charging hooves. You will feel the cut and slash of blades as you follow three very different rebels in their desperate fight against a tyrannical King.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silrith, the exiled Princess of Bennvika, stands shoulder to shoulder with her followers, sword in hand, ready to defend those in need of her protection. Yet she knows that if she falls, thousands more will also perish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina, of the Hentani tribe, burns with desire for revenge against those who oppress her people, but more than anything she must fight to protect the woman she could be executed for loving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun, an ambitious young politician, yearns for a fairer world with a greater voice for the poor. However, for him and his followers, to speak the word ‘republic’, could be a fatally dangerous move in a land ruled by a despot. Will the rebel factions succeed? Or in the indiscriminate butchery of war, will their disunity prove to be their downfall, bringing about the destruction of their world as they know it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With vivid imagery, a punchy writing voice, detailed worldbuilding and an unapologetically fast pace, Vengeance of Hope has everything an epic fantasy novel needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A queen turned warrior, a rebel protecting her tribe and an ambitious politician. All of them fight individually against one, the self proclaimed King of the Empire of Bennvika.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your ears will ring with the clang of steel on steel. Your heart will tremble at the thundering of charging hooves. You will feel the cut and slash of blades as you follow three very different rebels in their desperate fight against a tyrannical King.” (Extract from blurb)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was my first try at reading a fantasy (except Mahabharata and Ramayana. I studied those in my school and even gave exam as those were a part of curriculum). So this first try was definitely worth it. I really enjoyed the story, the characters and the plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason for a war is generally one amongst these (a) to acquire more land and hence wealth and power (b) to spread your culture/religion (c) revenge. But this book has it all. A greedy king who wants power to rule and also force his religious beliefs on the citizens. And a rightful Queen, who has been wrongly thrown away from the throne, who wants to avenge her father’s death and take up the throne for the well being of her Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development was amazing. Each character had a strong role and visibility. Powerful women, greedy men, ambitious politicians, and clueless masses. Everyone has their roles and those are written really well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with so much of fictional characters, locations, and terms, the author has tried to create a realistic world which is not at all boring and keeps you hooked to know ‘what next?’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t wait for the second part in the series - King of the Republic which is due to be released in December, 2019&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You must checkout the audio book of Vengeance Of Hope which is to be released in July, 2019.

Read this beautiful short story of mother-son relationship during contemporary times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also included is a tribute to the concluding chapters of an acclaimed fantasy-drama-series in television of the twenty-tens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Farewell is a short story about family relations nowadays. It is a story of mutual feeling of how we love each other, but we are shy to show it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is quite real. Today’s young generation have their goals and ambitions. People tend to believe that our goals are more important to us than our family. But it is not true. We just have different goals, different vision than our parents had years ago. That doesn’t mean that our love and respect for our elders is any less. We want to reach the sky but we also know the importance of keeping our feet on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel our generation is very much misunderstood. Our spontaneity does not mean that we are rude, it just means that we are aware. Our plans to go abroad for studies or just to live away from our family, doesn’t mean that we don’t love them; it just means that we want to be independent. We don’t want to bother our parents for every little thing. Our idea of settling down is not to get married and have kids. It is to earn enough to give ourselves and our family a much better and comfortable life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the way Debjeet Mukherjee has been able to present this basic emotion in the simplest way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Sep 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/09/the-farewell-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/09/the-farewell-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Paper Towns by John Green</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;Blurb:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs into his life—dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge—he follows. After their all-nighter ends, and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues—and they’re for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer he gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;My Review:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quentin Jacobsen is a usual teenage character having usual problems, and bunch of friends who are crazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there is Margo Roth Spiegelman, an adventurous girl. The one Q has a crush on since their childhood. The one who has now turned into a mystery, which Q has to unravel The book is filled with drama, suspense, and humour. John Green as always never ceases to surprise his readers with his wit and philosophy of life. Margo leaves a number of clues, intentionally as well as unintentionally for Q to find her. Gradually as Q join the dots, and as closer he gets to find her, the more he realises that this is not the Margo he once knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Margo leaves the clues from Woody Guthrie’s album to Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself. The clues are all over but not enough for a normal person to narrow it down to one particular place, where Margo could be found. But with his luck and his friends’ support, Q is going to find more than he thought he would. I won’t say that this book is something inspirational or motivational, since Margo runs away from her home, leaving behind her family and friends. But it definitely is a story about friendship. Margo thought that all of her friends ditched her, but the truth is there were people who genuinely cared about her. We always expect the people not to be themselves. We want them to behave the way we are comfortable with. And that is what the other person also thinks. This creates clashes and we think the other person don’t like us. Instead it is just what they are. You can’t change what you are. Similarly others can’t change what they are. And learning this basic thing could solve a hell lot of problems in our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you John Green for teaching your readers the basic life lessons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t even need to say this, but this book is definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Aug 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/21/paper-towns-by-john-green/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/21/paper-towns-by-john-green/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Hot Love Inferno by Nicky Blue</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A half-woman, half-cockroach fused in a bizarre gardening accident? That would be Mrs Jittery Twitch, dwelling in the shadows of our misdeeds. If in danger, you can call upon her help… all she asks is your soul as payment. But she’s just a legend, so no need to worry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barry Harris is a 28-year-old man, still living with his dear old mum in a little flat above a hairdresser. His obsession with Star Trek and the martial arts won’t help him when he’s forced out on a date. And nobody knows about the weird string of events that’s about to put everyone’s lives in danger. A trio of samurai warriors and the strangest offer of help lead Barry on a perilous mission to save the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(This book is the second in the Prophecy Allocation series but works fine as a standalone read.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why you should read this book:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It explains revolutionary insights into the nature of reality that debunk the myth of free will (probably).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It proves the multiverse has only two parallel universes (depending on your criteria for what makes up proof).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It contains 50% extra innuendo-based gags than Book One in the series. Some of them might be considered funny (again this is relative).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The author achieved a heightened dynamic tension not found in other books. He was heavily constipated during its creation. There may be a link. The author is no way suggesting that this makes it better than every other book ever written.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The book is written in British English. All British slang terms are helpfully translated for the international reader, along with a short explanation of why British people are a little strange.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot Love Inferno is the second book in Prophecy Allocation series. Though it can also be read as a standalone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a really interesting combination of science fiction, action, and dark comedy. It is full of quirky one liners which makes the read entertaining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I started the book, it was difficult to identify the characters, maybe because I haven’t read the part 1. But gradually I was able to connect to the characters and the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best part of the book is footnotes provided by author. It is funny and works as a bonus material at the end of each chapter. It is a fast paced story. Scenes take place one after other making some scenes a bit unclear. Some scenes and characters like Bertie Backwards and the Oracle seem out of place and are not really required in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this book if you like dark humour with a touch of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Aug 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/18/hot-love-inferno-by-nicky-blue/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/18/hot-love-inferno-by-nicky-blue/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Ascent of Love by Rooprashi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Taara met Vedant, she fell in love for the first time. However, she could not perceive that a feeling as pure as love can turn into something so toxic for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As she decided to leave her love behind and climb peaks of the world, she knew that the love for the peaks was not hers either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As she questions herself and is inept to understand why she is not able to forget her past, her ascent to the peaks was making the difference apparent to her. Something she already knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Had she found a new love, or was love back in an old package to spite her again? Does a difficult mountaineering course in Kashmir prove to be the turning point in her life? Will she be able to complete her ‘Ascent of Love’ the way she intended to, or will a hailstorm change the plan of her life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ascent of Love is the love story of Vedanth and Taara through the point of view of Taara, mostly set across the beauty of mountains and having a cameo of a storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is cliché romance which is nicely written. It takes you on a trip to Kashmir without you having to move an inch. The description of places and the beauty wants you to pack your bags and leave for Kashmir immediately. You can feel the serenity and the winds. (Lol no! That last part was a bit of exaggeration. You can’t feel the serenity and winds when the temperature around is nearly 50°C)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story transitions between past and present to simultaneously present the story of Taara and Vedanth over the leap of 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was an enjoyable and fast read. You can’t expect any twists and turns with this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover and the title are fitting for the storyline. The cover especially seems to come straight out of a movie poster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended for a light, cliché, not at all explicit romance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/29/the-ascent-of-love-by-rooprashi/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/29/the-ascent-of-love-by-rooprashi/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Big Switch by John Thomas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does a 24-year-old man want in life? Love? A decent job? Keith has both. He is a software engineer at a reputable company and has a girlfriend whom he loves a lot. Yet, there is something missing in his life. He is not even close to being happy. Only after losing his girlfriend, he realizes what the reason for his unhappiness is. He realizes that he is caught up in the wrong career. With time running out, he knows that he must switch to a new career — one that makes him happy. But, is 24 too late to do that? Is he making a mistake? Find out as Keith follows his heart in pursuit of an impossible-looking dream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Big Switch is a story is about pursuing your dreams. It reminds us that it is never too late to follow your heart. The story revolves around Keith, his life and his decision to pursue his dreams. Everyone else were merely supporting characters in his journey towards his goal. The author could have diverted from the main plot and went on explaining all the aspects of the story of other characters as well, but he was able to keep the focus of the story intact. Midway through the book, I thought that the decisions made by Keith were stupid and unrealistic, but it all started making sense over the course of story. Author was truly the god of the characters, writing their fates. Now, you do not question God’s ways. Do you? I love the character of Rahul. He is an amazing manager, a great leader, true friend and a determined supporter. Writing style is great and easily relatable. Characterization is done well. There are no ‘villians’ in the story. Who needs a villian in their life, when their lives already suck! The doubts in Keith’s mind are very real. Questioning your desires and your abilities is something very natural. He is confused, he is scared, but he is determined to make his dream come true. If you are currently working you might get some great tips in the book (not only how to switch your profession, but also how to stick to the job while being able to maintain a work – life balance) If you are a manager/leader you will know what TO BE and what NOT to be. This book makes you realise the importance of having good friends, a role model, and a dream. If you start working for thing you like to do, you’ll gradually find a way to reach a place where you are supposed to reach. Very much recommended if you are feeling stuck somewhere in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/the-big-switch-by-john-thomas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/the-big-switch-by-john-thomas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>WYRD - The Wild &amp; Weird Adventures of A + B (Part 1 - Japan) by Shasha Borya</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wyrd: The Wild and Weird Adventures of A + B is a travelogue of two people Aleks and Boris in different parts of the world. This particular book is a description of their travel to Japan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks in length about Japan, the culture, various locations, the people and the food around there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just loved the vibes of the book. It is cool, adventurous, spontaneous and humorous. Like any unplanned travel to an unknown place, with language barriers, this book is also full of realisation about cultural differences and flawed Google translations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever been in such a situation, you will know how relatable the book is. And moreover if you are vegetarian/vegan at a place dominated by non vegetarians, then you can’t stop sympathizing with the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is fun to read. The descriptions are so detailed that it actually takes the reader on a tour of Japan. Not having visited Japan myself, it has intrigued me to go there atleast once in my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you love to travel, and you want to go to Japan this book will tell you honest do’s and don’ts. And even if you don’t want to go to Japan then this book would give you a trip in the comfort of your bed (though you can’t resist the idea of going to Japan after reading it.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/WYRD-part-1-Japan-by-Shasha-Borya/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/WYRD-part-1-Japan-by-Shasha-Borya/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Joshua’s 7 Gifts by Trishala Ahalpara</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Alicia Grey and I have a story to tell. It all started the last Summer when I decided to visit my grandpa in the small town of Brakonhall. There I met a guy named Joshua Summerfied. For me, he was the average guy from the village nothing so interesting about him. But this guy had a secret and a task in hand. For me the task was simple, to gift his anonymous friend Joanna Willow something which he never had. But what was that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-review-contains-spoiler&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is based on the theme of colors. It speaks of the importance of colors. We normally take such things (as the ability to see) for granted. This story makes us sympathize with those who can’t see clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story started like a “Dora The Explorer” expedition to find something. Here it was 7 gifts of the 7 colors of a rainbow. I would have loved it more had it shown the description of Joshua’s understanding of colors in a better and a little more detailed way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The focus was immediately shifted from colorful gifts to Joshua which decreased the value of gifts in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, the grammar was bad at some place making it a fluency breaker in the reading process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story though predictable was a nice read. I would recommend the book if you are looking for a short and fresh read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/13/joshuas-7-gifts-by-trishala-ahalpara/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/13/joshuas-7-gifts-by-trishala-ahalpara/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Mehboob Murderer by Nupur Anand</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a rainy September night, six people are gunned down mercilessly in an old Parsi cafe in Mumbai. The mass murder at Cafe Mehboob, located barely a few hundred meters from the police station, and right next to one of the busiest railway stations in Mumbai, jolts the city out of its complacence. The media immediately swings into action, while political pressure mounts on the police force to nab the murderer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With everyone eager to place the blame of the murders on a madman in a bid to have the case dismissed swiftly, the headstrong inspector Intekhaab Abbas is determined to get to the bottom of the murders. On probing the lives of the victims, he stumbles upon a heady cocktail of love, lust, jealousy, betrayal, rage, longing, misery and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mehboob Murderer, Nupur Anand’s debut novel, unravels a stunning truth neither the police nor the reader is prepared for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mehboob Murderer is based on an interesting plot of a mass murder of 6 people in Café Mehboob. It is difficult to nab the criminal as there is no clue or evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6 victims and 5 suspects. All having a reason to commit the murder. Through the journey of solving the case, the reader gets a glimpse of the back story of all the victims and the potential murderers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The build up of the story is nicely done but it was predictable. I was able to point out the murderer in the first half of the story, though what kept me hooked was the reason of the murder and an interest in knowing the story of all the potential murderers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this novel if you want to have a light mystery, where not a lot of efforts is required in understanding what is happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/04/mehboob-murderer-by-nupur-anand/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/04/mehboob-murderer-by-nupur-anand/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Metamorphosis by Ivy Logan</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amelia, Peradora’s teenage heiress is a fashionista and boasts of 6 million followers on Twitter. In reality she is a bit of an introvert, a prisoner in a golden cage and her ‘it girl’ image is nothing but a carefully crafted, elaborate P.R. plan, masterminded by her guardian, Liam, the dictator of Peradora.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As secrets from her past dodge her at every turn, can Amelia choose between Adrian, the adventure junkie, her first love and Noah, the handsome bodyguard, and her best friend? Do they have secrets of their own, they’re keeping from her?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Peradora, her beloved nation is in trouble, and a sorceress ancestor, grants Amelia the ability to shape shift. Will it prove to be a curse or a boon? Will the power be too much for Amelia to handle? And can it truly change who she is inside, a frightened girl, quite out of her depth?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a stunning set of events unfold, will the truth set Amelia free or will she learn that some secrets are best buried in the past?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amelia, Peradora’s teenage heiress, is being used by Liam, her uncle to keep up his diamond business. Amelia gradually comes afront with the secrets that have been kept hidden from her for years. And with the secrets come a great responsibility of saving her nation, Peradora and a gift of shape shifting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is part 2 of Breach Chronicles, but can be read as a stand alone. Though you need to read the upcoming part to know what happens next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has a nice element of Urban Fantasy. I liked the characters. The role of woman in fighting for themselves as well as their loved ones is what I loved in this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover is not representative of the story, but works nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the author repeating same stuff over and over in the book while skipping main parts like how exactly did a fight took place etc. This kind of made me lose my interest in the otherwise good plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Jun 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/06/07/metamorphosis-by-ivy-logan/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/06/07/metamorphosis-by-ivy-logan/</guid> </item> <item> <title>When Stars Align by E.K. McCoy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you believe in destiny—a predetermined, irresistible course of events that no act of human intervention can deter? Dr. Augustus Owens, an ER trauma specialist, does. He believes an invisible force is always present with him and is the deciding factor between life or death. Dr. Owens realizes that in life we can only do so much before something else takes control and decides fate for us.But what role does destiny play in love? How much control do we really have in matters of the heart?As is true with most young medical residents, confident and determined Dr. Owens cannot afford to waste time on girls or parties. He works long and hard and is dedicated to advancing his career at any cost. So why is he feeling so undeniably drawn to the mysterious girl he spotted at a frat party next door? Almost as if under a spell, a sudden vulnerability consumes him, and he feels the need to be as close to her as he possibly can be.On the pages of this book fate and time weave a riveting, heartwarming tale of why Dr. Owens was forced in her direction from the minute he laid eyes on her. Their paths were destined to cross, and there was no stopping destiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Stars Align is a love story of a guy who is a Doctor and a girl who is pursuing Music as a major in her college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It talks about the struggles of being a doctor. How a doctor finds it difficult to be available for their family because of their priority being to save lives of other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elsie is an under-confident girl who does not recognises her singing talent when everyone around her does. She is shy, introvert and overconcious. Auggie is a doctor whose only priority is his work which seems to change when he meets Elsie. He is hot, smart and humourous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a story of love influenced by time and destiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of romance, but books like these take a special in my heart because of their writing style. The dialogues are so powerful and the characters so meaningful that you can’t not cry or feel their plight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favourite character is Marie, for always being there for her best friend, Elsie. She didn’t just only say that she was like her sister, she proved it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are ups and downs in this book as every romance has but I loved the way the suspense was maintained throughout the book. Why and how things happened, were revealed slowly, keeping the reader hooked to the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book if you are looking for something different than a cheesy romance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/29/when-stars-align-by-ek-mccoy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/29/when-stars-align-by-ek-mccoy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Unobliterated by Samridhhi Manadawat</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered the emotions of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a girl who is in love for the first time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a girl who gets her periods for the first time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;successful woman who undergoes an emotional stress&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;women who breastfeed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;emotions running through a rape survivor&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a widow who masturbates out of her unusual sexual desires&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;desires and hopes of a prostitute from the society and such allied topics?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unobiliterated is a collection of poetries, which talk about women and topics revolving around women. These topics are the variety of emotions and situations faced by women around the world. The writer boldly and openly talks about stuff such as sexuality, motherhood, rape and prostitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple yet touching. The author successfully takes the reader to the dark side of life of a woman, which is more than often is left untalked and undiscussed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a short read and definitely recommended if you want to explore more about the life of a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/24/unobliterated-by-samridhhi-mandawat/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/24/unobliterated-by-samridhhi-mandawat/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Falling for Fallon by S.J. Sylvis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow, at the ripe age of twenty-three, I find myself in line to marry a man I don’t love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grind my teeth right there at the dinner table as my mother and father go on and on about how proud they are of me, how proud they are that I, Fallon Addington, will no longer be the black sheep of the family and become the daughter they’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marry Derek and they’ll finally accept me. Marry Derek and they’ll stop shoving men from their “social circle” in my direction. Marry Derek and become the spitting image of my mother; the perfect corporate wife with a face full of make-up and not a hair out of line. Marry Derek and all the shame and guilt will disappear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then… I embarrassingly flash Emmett Lanning my bra and suddenly my parents’ hopes and dreams are burning up in flames, right there along with my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the second novel in the Oak Hill Series, but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about Fallon, a girl from super rich family, who falls in love with a guy from Oak Hill, Emmett, who is the brother of Dawson (protagonist from book 1 of the series). Hence new characters are introduced in the second installment of the series while keeping the characters from 1st book intact. But this doesn’t require the reader to go through the 1st book before reading the 2nd one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story was predictable, the writing style was brilliant. I really enjoyed reading the story. The emotions that came with the book were raw and real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed how the honestly the dillemas of Fallon were shown throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book takes the reader on a journey of a forced arranged marriage, family drama, friend turned lover, all whilst trying to learn to choose oneself before others. Making yourself the priority is not selfish, it is healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book was a fun read. Though slow initially the author was able to keep the reader hooked with quirky characters and captivating dialogues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a light romantic comedy or a rich girl and not so rich guy kind of story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/23/falling-for-fallon-by-sj-sylvis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/23/falling-for-fallon-by-sj-sylvis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Snapped Threads by Riddhi Agarwal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;She turned the key of her car and it sputtered to life. She jammed the accelerator as the engine roared. With all her might, she pulled the gears and the world behind them blurred away. As they pushed past the house, she heard a deafening scream from a familiar voice. “Enigma!” The lady cried as the people in the market turned in hopes of gathering new gossip. Marinated in a world of competition, Snapped Threads is a portrayal of a struggle for justice. The story weaves together diverse lives against the backdrop of an art theft. Renewing the essence of love, friendship, betrayal, ambition and greed, the story is a reflection of an encounter made at the crossroads of deception and loyalty. The characters embark on new journeys-some with the desires to fulfill dreams, some to satisfy the hunger for wealth and power and some in search of acceptance in an altering world. A tryst with life and a celebration of love, the crime thriller is set at the dawn of a new beginning, bringing into its folds the commitments, responsibilities and perceptions that result from a serious theme attempted in a light environment. Flip through the pages to discover how the characters eventually let the threads roll out the paths of these new journeys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snapped Threads is a refreshing story about an art theft. It is brilliantly written in a very simplistic manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is surprising is that the story is written by a 16 year old girl. The knowledge that the author holds about art, exhibitions, and “the dark world” is commendable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks about love, friendship, betrayal, lust and greed for power and fame. How a person would go to any extent to fulfill his desires. It also stresses on the theme that a person with good intentions can make a bad person realise their mistakes and the harm they have caused to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development was excellent. How the characters are made to do things they would have never wanted to do just because someone was able to hit their weakest chord and manipulate them to do things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a mostly unpredictable story with lots of twists and turns.Though some stupid acts done by characters which were totally unreasonable and were disappointing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story was able to keep me hooked since beginning. As I progressed towards the end of the book, I was wondering whether the story is going to have a satisfactory end or am I going to be left at a cliffhanger. But I must say that the author gave an end to the story, which might slightly appear rushed up, but completes the story. A bit more details though would have made the book more loveable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for a refreshing read, with a good amount of thrill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/20/snapped-threads-by-riddhi-agarwal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/20/snapped-threads-by-riddhi-agarwal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Where The Forest Meets The Stars by Glendy Vanderah</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;blurb-in-this-gorgeously-stunning-debut-a-mysterious-child-teaches-two-strangers-how-to-love-and-trust-again&quot;&gt;Blurb: In this gorgeously stunning debut, a mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again.&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the loss of her mother and her own battle with breast cancer, Joanna Teale returns to her graduate research on nesting birds in rural Illinois, determined to prove that her recent hardships have not broken her. She throws herself into her work from dusk to dawn, until her solitary routine is disrupted by the appearance of a mysterious child who shows up at her cabin barefoot and covered in bruises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girl calls herself Ursa, and she claims to have been sent from the stars to witness five miracles. With concerns about the child’s home situation, Jo reluctantly agrees to let her stay—just until she learns more about Ursa’s past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jo enlists the help of her reclusive neighbor, Gabriel Nash, to solve the mystery of the charming child. But the more time they spend together, the more questions they have. How does a young girl not only read but understand Shakespeare? Why do good things keep happening in her presence? And why aren’t Jo and Gabe checking the missing children’s website anymore?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the three have formed an incredible bond, they know difficult choices must be made. As the summer nears an end and Ursa gets closer to her fifth miracle, her dangerous past closes in. When it finally catches up to them, all of their painful secrets will be forced into the open, and their fates will be left to the stars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;My Review:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the story. It is fresh and keeps you hooked since the beginning. The plot is great about a girl coming from stars and making good things happen to good people. The writing style is brilliant and the story made me cry at more than one point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds the past of all the characters is bought to light. The reader understands the characters and their decisions. It makes you believe in trust and love. It makes you believe that good things happen to good people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The young girl, Ursa is wise beyond her years. She is smart and knows what she wants. She came looking for five miracles and with each miracle, she teaches us that life is full of wonders if you have an eye for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title is very apt for the story. Jo works in the forest for her field study for research. So the forest plays a very important role in the story. Also, Ursa claims that she has come from stars. Hence that is another important aspect of the story. Where the Forest Meets the Stars, therefore, justifies the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/19/where-the-forest-meets-the-stars-by-glendy-vanderah/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/19/where-the-forest-meets-the-stars-by-glendy-vanderah/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Two Girls in Love by Ankita Singh</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Girls In Love is the story of a young, Indian woman, written in the form of poetic diary entries. It follows her journey from the moment she realizes that she’s free to be with whomever she wants to be with and that no law would stop her anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Girls In Love is short, like a few pages torn out of someone’s diary. But it tells a heartwarming tale of being true to yourself in a place where the people still may not be ready to accept you for who you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a story of hope, of love, of true friendships…it’s the story of two girls who are so in love with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Two Girls in Love” is a story of girl, who introduces the readers to her sexuality, in form of poetic diary entries. The diary entry starts from the day when article 377 was struck down in India, giving LGBTQ community their well deserved rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and decent. The protagonist’s confusion about her own sexuality, the fear and the sense of freedom are all cleary shown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the shortness and the crispness of the story. It was to the point and kept up my interest till the last word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for a short and powerful read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Apr 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/07/two-girls-in-love-by-ankita-singh/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/07/two-girls-in-love-by-ankita-singh/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Nowhere by Chris Gill</title> <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two boys. Two farms. One deadly secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Every day’s the same on the farm. Seventeen-year-old Seb rides his quad bike alongside his dad and cattle dog, dreaming about a different life. A life that doesn’t require him to spend all day in the blistering sun. Where the nearest town isn’t a forty-minute drive away with a population of fewer than three hundred people. Where he can talk to someone who isn’t his little brother or short-tempered father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when new neighbours move into the derelict farm on the opposite side of the shrub, Seb hopes his luck is finally about to change. Could Jake, the enigmatic boy with a dangerous glint in his eye, be his ticket out of The Nowhere? And if so, how far are they both willing to go to escape?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast forward two decades and Seb’s working as a nurse back in Perth. With his dad living in his home, Seb is tormented by the demons that have followed him his entire adult life. He begins confiding in his caring colleague Sandra, who convinces him the only way he’ll be able to move forward is to exorcise his ghosts and seek closure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when Jake calls out the blue telling Seb he’s coming to visit, Seb has to decide whether he’s ready to face exactly what happened that summer. On the night that forever changed not only the lives of the two boys, but that their entire families.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around a really interesting plot. Two kids dreaming of running away from their town – The Nowhere. But still not satisfied when they get what they have wanted for so long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story of one-sided love, family drama, friendship, teenage desires, and broken dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way the author transitioned to and fro past and present. Revealing just enough to keep the story going on while maintaining the curiosity of the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are great. They are influenced by their pasts but they are trying to get over it. Trying to get closure from their past. I think this is something which needs to be learned from the story. The past shape you, but you must not let the past have too much control over you. You need to understand the importance of letting things go. If you can’t change it, there is no use of regretting over it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for LGBTQ theme, less romance, and more drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Apr 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/06/the-nowhere-by-chris-gill/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/06/the-nowhere-by-chris-gill/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Kaleidoscope of Love by Priyanka Bhuyan</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love, the strongest human emotion to ever exist. But what is love and why are its colour so myriad? Love can range from the purest form of mother’s love to the tragic feeling of unrequited love. And also to the silent love which continues even after it is gone. Love is basically like a kalaidescope and it changes colour in all human relations with time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaleidoscope Of Love is a collection of 10 short stories from fairy tale love to heartbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some stories are very sweet and makes you feel awestruck. I personally loved “O My Love It Was You!“. A guy who likes this girl, is doing whatever he can to woo her, directly or indirectly. It is cute and no doubt quite filmy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While on the other hand there is a story “Mirage and Reality“. The guy is desperate to feel loved. He rejects a girl (because (a) he has never met her before and his parents have fixed their marriage (b) she is too simple to be able to adjust in UK), then is rejected by his girlfriend (because she is not looking for marriage and is focusing on her career) and then rushes back to first girl to apologise and marry her (because he has to get married, no matter to whom).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On an overall level the stories are good, but had a scope for betterment. The stories are too short to connect at an emotional level. You don’t relate to the characters or their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/27/Kaleidoscope-of-Love-by-Priyanka-Bhuyan/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/27/Kaleidoscope-of-Love-by-Priyanka-Bhuyan/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Temple Origins by Chris Patt</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fate Sisters turn a promise into a curse, and the Bloodborne Legacy begins.

Introduction of characters is thoughtfully done. And their roles and responsibilities as per the plot of the story has been clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept is impressive and definitely makes me eager to read the first book of the series - Reign Drops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some errors in the text, which hindered my reading experience and I hope it won’t be so in the coming novels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/23/temple-origins-by-chris-patt/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/23/temple-origins-by-chris-patt/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Chance Encounter by Christi Whitson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy: What started as a writing exercise ended with me giving a hot guy a fake number. Not my finest hour. I never thought I’d see Donovan again, but he turned up in the most unlikely of places. And this time, he’s made it clear he has no intention of letting me get away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donovan: When I saw her in that cafe, my whole world shifted. I didn’t want to spend another second of my life not knowing her. She enchanted me from the very first glance, but almost every word from her lips was a lie. And when she gave me a fake name and vanished, it seemed fate was determined to make me a fool. When I finally found her again, the bombshell she dropped would’ve sent most men running. But I’m not most men. And even the mother of all roadblocks won’t stop me from claiming her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author’s Note: Chance Encounter is a light-hearted, stand-alone contemporary romance with a HEA. You do not need to read the rest of the Fates Aligned series to enjoy the book. Be prepared for unexpected twists, a moderate helping of steamy goodness, and a sweet book-boyfriend with a dirty mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around themes such as friendship, love, sacrifice and motherhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are awesome and immediately lovable. They are realistically developed. They deal with good and bad, truths and lies, in a way any real person would actually do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t expect much twists and turns. It is a straight forward cheesy romance story involving a ‘tadka’ of family drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is fast paced but maintains its quality throughout. Though I expected a little more of ‘scenes’ at the end which would make me feel emotionally connected to Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light romance read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/15/chance-encounter-by-christi-whitson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/15/chance-encounter-by-christi-whitson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Rural Coincidence</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are village folks really that simple? What happens when rural people start gambling on drugs? Can a small girl from a village break the existing social stigma and become ‘modern’? Are love stories restricted to urban areas? Do genetics play a role in shaping decisions related to mischief? To what length can a father go to get his daughter the more important things in life? Can fulfillment come without education? Read this riveting short story of twists and turns in a village depicting the life of a farmer, his family and the village postman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Rural Coincidence is an exciting journey of a farmer, his family, and the village postman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I started reading it, I had no clue what to expect from the story. But what came was a surprising story about the intricacies of the minds of the village people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a fun short read. Though it had some grammatical errors but that does not deter the reader from enjoying the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend buying a Kindle edition of the book as I feel it would give more worth to the money spent than a physical book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/a-rural-coincidence-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/a-rural-coincidence-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Zomu and the Big-Head by K. S. Das</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Appearing sane is a task for Zomu. He goes to a place he had never been to; there he meets ‘The Big-head’. He is the mystic, the magician. Zomu knows ‘the big-head’ has all the answers, and ‘the big-head’ knows, Zomu has all the right questions. Both of them had waited for each other, all their life. But Zomu is afraid and shy of asking out all those right questions. The big head, the all-knowing; has some unheard of methods to get inside Zomu’s small head and get those questions out. The drama, the mystery, the thrill, and bundle of emotions unfold as ‘the big-head’ try out his unheard of methods on Zomu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zomu and the Big-head is an interesting story based on real life incident which is told about at the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story about substance abuse, addiction and a psycho killer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially starting as a simple story of a shy guy Zomu, going to bank to open an account, you gradually realise there is something more to it. Incidents start to catch your attention as you begin to realise that something peculiar is going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unconventional, and an intriguing story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/Zomu-and-the-big-head-by-ks-das/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/Zomu-and-the-big-head-by-ks-das/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Divyastra by Nimish Tanna</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thousands of years ago, Indian Yogis possessed the knowledge to obtain the weapons of the gods. However, this knowledge could only be transferred from a Guru to his disciple by word of mouth. In today’s world, one mystic, who calls himself Guruji, still possesses this knowledge and is using it to empower an innocent person’s life. Only, this empowerment could be a deception and the innocent person is a thirteen year old boy with a stutter… In this intertwining tale, an ambitious yet unsuccessful Shankar, in search of his identity, is manipulated to embark on a never-told-before fantasy tale; only to rediscover the father he never knew and unmask the mystical Guruji. Amidst this confounding concoction of ancient myths, deluding personas and dispersed emotions, will Shankar ever be able to separate fact from fiction and find his true identity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A mix of mythology, fantasy and science, Divyastra takes you on a journey full of myths and facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has put in a lot of efforts in research about the astras and shastras. And that is definitely visible as the story progresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is quite a different read than what people are used to reading under the genre of fantasy. I was not really a fan of this genre but the story genuinely interested me. It hooks you up from chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way the story unfolds is very clever and smartly executed. Unpredictable twists and turns keeps you eager to read more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are fan of Hindu mythology or not, this novel will make you enjoy every second you put into it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/07/divyastra-by-nimish-tanna/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/07/divyastra-by-nimish-tanna/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Dark Side Of The Moon by Shubham Arora</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dark Side Of The Moon is a collection of short stories that are dark, grim and flirt ambitiously with notions of the unexplained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volume 1 includes three fast paced stories which are bound to keep you hooked -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;THE LAST SKYPE: What do you do when you are thousands of miles away from the person you love? You Skype. But what if what you see isn’t what it actually is?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IN MY HEAD: All killers have a motive. People don’t kill out of necessity; people kill because they want to kill. Would a mother murdering her own child have a motive too? He has seven days to find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;THE RITUAL: It’s been 33 years. The comet is returning. His god is returning. The time is right for The Ritual. Will his god come home?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the three stories deal in the depths of mind. They are something which you wouldn’t want to agree with readily (being educated enough, questioning the unseeable, and believing in logics) but also they are something which is not clearly deniable. If we have a peek into the past, we can come up with several such incidences, which deny logic and science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I appreciate the way, the author chose this theme, keeping it both believably true and unbelievably spooky and unnatural.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title justifies the 3 stories. “The Dark Side Of The Moon” which is not visible, but is there. As complex and unnatural the changing shapes of the moon is despite us knowing the science of it, so are the three stories of this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for short, spooky reads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/03/The-Dark-Side-Of-The-Moon-by-Shubham-Arora/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/03/The-Dark-Side-Of-The-Moon-by-Shubham-Arora/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Nightmarescape by Jonathan Fortin</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bliss is a city of nightmares, and all Grace wants is to get her daughter out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years ago, the residents of Bliss discovered that their nightmares were becoming real. Ever since, the city has steadily transformed into a surreal, twisted hellscape. Massive walls trap the residents in with bloodthirsty monsters and indescribable terrors. No one knows if it’s even possible to escape alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace, an African-American mother, spends her days searching for a way out of the city to give her daughter Sam a chance at a real future. But when Sam is kidnapped by a shadow from their past, mother and daughter alike are forced to face their greatest fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although it is a short story, the author was able to touch upon all the details required to weave this story. From describing the situation of the city, Bliss (which is quite ironical, because bliss means perfect happiness, while the city is filled with the terror of nightmares) as in present vs. how it was initially, to the people facing the terror of nightmares and finally to the scene in which Sam is kidnapped and then what happens later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything is vividly described and I can just imagine what a great movie can be made based on this story. Quite similar to yet a lot different from the theme of “Birdbox”, this short story is capable of being made into a long length novel as well as movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were definitely certain parts in the story which could have been written in a more descriptive manner, but owing to the short length of the story I don’t mind missing onto such details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you liked “Birdbox” - either movie or book, then this 16 pages long story would definitely interest you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/02/nightmarescape-by-jonathan-fortin/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/02/nightmarescape-by-jonathan-fortin/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Surviving McCoy by EK McCoy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up, my sisters and I played rough, and throughout the years we were known to have several fist fights. A day didn’t pass without one of us ending up with a new scratch or bruise, and we certainly had our fair share of stitches. We were always covered in dirt. We played and fought like boys, but we held grudges and sought revenge like girls. Our grandfather Poppy gave us the nickname The McCoy Boys. Looking back, I wish us McCoy Boys would have known what we know now—that life really does pass in the blink of an eye, and throughout your life friends will come and go, but you’ll always have your family. Those moments when we all got along and acted like not only friends but sisters who loved and cared for one another were some of the best moments of my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surviving McCoy is a mostly true memoir of the life of the author. It is the journey of the author, from her birth till after her marriage and having 2 kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being the youngest of the three sisters she has faced a fair (I would rather say unfair) share of bully. Like in any other household, Em, the youngest sister is being bullied by her 2 elder sisters, Charlie and Liz. But I think these girls took sisterly fights to another level. She wouldn’t even dare to complain about her sisters’ deeds to her parents since she was so scared of them. I frankly have not witnessed such behaviour in my or my friends’ or relatives’ houses. Hence, I found the behaviour of Charlie rather more deregotary than what the author must have aimed to show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the parents seem quite ignorant about the behaviour of their kids. My mom would have taken a good class of me and my sister had we done anything close to what the McCoy boys were upto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gradually, as the McCoy boys grow up, and separate from their home for higher studies, they realise each other’s values in their lives. They realise the importance of their sisters and parents. They find out how pure and unconditional the love of a family is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It not only talks about relationship with sister and parents but also grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, boyfriends and husbands. Each relationship in its truest sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an innocent compilation of the memorable moments of the authors life. And I must say I enjoyed this journey. It is a light read. It feels like you are talking to a friend who is complaining about her sister and family. And you are just like “I know right. I feel you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended If you think that your relationship with your siblings is bad. If you think that parenting is difficult. If you think being a single parent is much more difficult. If you think your kids are a pain in the ass. This book will definitely make you feel better about your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>01 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/01/surviving-mccoy-by-ek-mccoy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/01/surviving-mccoy-by-ek-mccoy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Peach by Wayne Barton</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;.Following the untimely passing of a close friend, British songwriter and producer, Freddie Ward, arrives in Bliss, Idaho to work on a comeback album with beloved singer-songwriter, Hal Granger. Adrift and bereft, Freddie is looking to gain a sense of perspective after a series of bad decisions—decisions that cost him his relationship and life as he knows it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, almost as soon as Freddie arrives in Idaho, Hal drops an unexpected and devastating bombshell. Far from the hustle and bustle of his life in England, out in the stark isolation of the northwestern U.S., with time to think, to reflect, Freddie slowly begins to rebuild his life, haunted both by the events of the recent past and his reactions to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peach is a very beautifully written novel and an instant classic. It allows the reader to think about their lives as the author takes us on the journey of Freddie’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very simplistically and realistically executed, Peach, talks about the struggles in the life of an artist or any other normal person. Inability to focus, blaming others and finding excuses while procrastinating the work. Not just the work related struggles, but struggles in maintaining relationships, romantic or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire novel feels like an experience. As if you are talking to your grandparents. You try to understand what they are speaking because it contains a lot more meaning than its words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel hits the right chord of readers’ hearts in such a way that you won’t even realise. It is a story which will stay with you for years to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a slow, and simple story, trying to deal with the high-lows of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/27/peach-by-wayne-barton/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/27/peach-by-wayne-barton/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she’ll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially you find Eleanor a very dumb character. She is a thirty year something old woman who seems to have no idea of the world around her. She doesn’t know the difference between a computer, a laptop and a tablet, when she herself is an finance clerk whose 9-5 job revolves around a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as the story unfolds you get to know about Eleanor’s past bit by bit. You understand why she acts the way she do. You feel bad for her and for what she is going through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raymond comes as a light of hope in the dark and dull life of Eleanor. As they get more friendly, he realises that there is something wrong in Eleanor’s life and does his best to make it better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a heartbreaking story about a girl who has always been told that she is not good enough. It is a story of true friendship and relations which are thicker than blood. It is a story of a loner who realises that you need to surround yourself with the people who love you unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The end takes an unpredictable turn making the reader take Eleanor’s entire journey on a more serious note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautifully written story which is heart touching and definitely makes you fall in love with its characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>22 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/22/Eleanor-Oliphant-is-Completely-Fine-by-Gail-Honeyman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/22/Eleanor-Oliphant-is-Completely-Fine-by-Gail-Honeyman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>No Solicitors by John Callas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lewis Cutterman is a well respected brain surgeon and happliy married with two beautiful children who run the family business. They are model citizens within the community. A simple visit to their home by a beautiful saleswoman is greeted by an invitation to dinner. But dinner takes a deadly turn when the woman finds herself drugged by the family. Waking up in a basement, strapped to an operating table, and surrounded by other prisoners of the Cutterman family, she quickly discovers that their captors intend to remove and sell their internal organs on the black market. And then to get rid of the evidence, they will all be slowly eaten, piece… by … piece.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is one of the most scary, dark, torturous and egregious novels I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I don’t know if it should be called a good book or a bad one. Bad because it is so gross that you sometimes wish to drop it. And good because it comes up so graphically gross that you sometimes wish to drop it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is very smartly written that you want to curse the characters and kill them and let them burn in hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you can read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DARE: Watch the movie. (Though I haven’t watched it but since the movie is directed by the author himself you can just imagine how hard he might have worked to create his vision.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/09/no-solicitors-by-john-callas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/09/no-solicitors-by-john-callas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Dreaming of Tomorrow by V.

One do-over changed my world more than I could imagine. Emily. Six weeks ago she crashed into my life without warning, alleviated my burdens, then wrenched out my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Austin McKenna battled for years to live up to impossible expectations. Emily Dixon showed him what it was like to love and be loved unconditionally, accepting and understanding him in his entirety. Never had Austin experienced a longing or loss that compared to losing her. She was the first woman he willingly bore his soul to, and now he was determined to claim her back once and for all… No matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike the first installment of the duet - Living for Today, which was written with the point of view of Emily, Dreaming of Tomorrow is written with the point of view of Austin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time Austin travels all the way from San Francisco to New Zealand just to see his love after long months of separation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author is able to maintain same level of interest in this book as in the first one. The characters have developed in a great way over the course of time. 2 philophobic people falling in love with each other, the constant fear of their respective exes, worries of their parents are all very beautifully shown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending seemed rushed up. Looks like the author did not spend much time on the closure of the past of both Emily and Austin. I was expecting more by the time I finished the book. I personally loved 1st book better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you are looking for just a cute romance then I would recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/07/dreaming-of-tomorrow-by-vr-baucke/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/07/dreaming-of-tomorrow-by-vr-baucke/</guid> </item> <item> <title>You Begin Where I End by Sarang Jairaj</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to love two people at the same time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nafisa is dealing with beers, periods, heartbreak, and dating apps, when she meets her new uniquely average boyfriend. But is he the love of her life? Before Nafisa can figure that out, her life is turned upside down. Her mother Tamanna dies in an accident. In trying to come to terms with her loss, she finds solace in the company of a charming painter. Her life takes a retro turn, with diaries, handwritten letters, and music trying to heal her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tamanna is busy simply existing and complaining, when a gorgeous poet takes her on a whirlwind philosophical journey, teaching her to appreciate art, nature, human existence, and love. But is he the love of her life? Before Tamanna can figure that out, her marriage is arranged with an extraordinarily ordinary guy. Amidst arranged marriages, honour killings, letters of blood, and melting ice-golas, Tamanna shall discover her brand of love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You Begin Where I End spins two unconventional love stories, set two decades apart – 1991 and 2015 – trying to find an answer to the eternal dilemma of darlings – What is love?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved how the author is able to weave the story of two different worlds in such a beautiful way. Each words seeps into your heart and grows to become a tree of thoughts, branching into different possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simple joys of an average girl are gloriously shown like sitting on the window side of a bus, star gazing and silent walks with your love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the book was what kept me hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of references of things without using their names for example - ‘an app that sounds like hinder’ was a bit pesky. It is pretty obvious what it is being referred to, and naming it directly wouldn’t have hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the different definitions of love as provided by author. Everyone has different meanings, different understanding about love. And no one is wrong, which is cleverly shown in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t mind saying it is a uniquely average book and I would definitely recommend it for a light read. Such book, much love&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;P.S. Don’t judge the book by its cover. The girl in the cover is not at all the fat girl who describes herself as panda in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/04/you-begin-where-i-end-by-sarang-jairaj/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/04/you-begin-where-i-end-by-sarang-jairaj/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Take My Heart Forever by Arpit Agrawal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Siddhartha, a good lawyer but a bad human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Rahul, a good human but a bad doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And meet Shuchi, a good human and an exceptionally well doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shuchi tries to make a good human out of Siddhartha and a good doctor out of Rahul, but a bomb blast transforms their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read this revolutionary tale to know how Siddhartha will get a unique PIL passed in the courtroom and Rahul will perform a life changing surgery, to save the girl they love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take my heart, forever is a beautifully written, and simple story involving realistic characters. It takes us through one of the most horrific incidents faced by India - the Mumbai bomb blast. The author takes the reader on an emotional journey of poor medical condition of India, injustice by the hands of the rich and powerful, and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is definitely heart touching and makes the reader beg for a reform in our country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want powerful and smart lawyers like Siddhartha given that they fight not for money but for the righteousness. We want doctors like Shuchi who devote themselves selflessly for treatment of the underprivileged. We want humans like Rahul who can restore humanity in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be learned from this story, a lot to work upon for the betterment of our country, and a lot to be disccused and debated amongst the citizens but gradually accepted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this novel to the readers from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/27/take-my-heart-forever-by-arpit-agrawal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/27/take-my-heart-forever-by-arpit-agrawal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Underdog Parade by Michael Mihaley</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the summer of the drought, a boy must decide if his neighbor’s ark is lunacy or a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the summer of the drought, but thirteen-year-old Peter “Nemo” Grady has bigger problems on his mind than the weather. He hates his new home in the exclusive golf club community Willow Creek Landing. His parents are always fighting and he can’t escape the memory of his last seizure—when he flopped around the gymnasium floor like a fish out of water—earning him his dreaded nickname. To top it all off, Peter has no friends, but he receives plenty of unsolicited attention from Chipper, the boy scout super-bully who also happens to be a resident of Willow Creek. His only companion is his little sister, CJ, who thinks she is Wonder Woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter is all too aware that you don’t need rain in the forecast to have dark clouds overhead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things change when he meets his new neighbor, the mysterious Joshua, who predicts the drought will end with a storm of biblical proportions. Peter looks to his visiting, wheelchair-bound Uncle Herb, and his neighbors, Mr. James and Mr. Terry, for guidance as Josh prepares for imminent doom. With each passing day, Peter realizes that sooner or later he will have to rely on the strength of the lamest, most jelly-weak individual he knows—himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the plot of the story. It revolves around themes like bully, adjustment problems at a new place, living with a person with disability, family problems etc. It is simple and can even be read to students since there is a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each character was given equal space to present themselves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Characters are developed very intricately and realistically. You can actually connect to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Story is slow. I got through the book at a very low speed. It was difficult to keep up the interest for a long time. But it was able to hook me by the last few chapters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can keep up with a slow paced but a good story, then I would recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/24/the-underdog-parade-by-michael-mihaley/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/24/the-underdog-parade-by-michael-mihaley/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Words of Void by Sandhiya Palanisamy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of void is a collection of poetry, prose and quotes about life. It explores around pain, love, heart break and happiness of people who wanna change themselves but also tired of society wanting them to stay where they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of void takes you through the journey of the darkness of life and finds still light in them, because if you keep moving forward there is light at the end of every tunnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of Void is a beautiful collection of quotes, poetries and proses. Written from the point of view of a girl, who is oppressed and assaulted. A girl, whose dreams are shattered and has been abused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The theme revolves around love, lust, pain, sexual assault and dreams broken by family and society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The words are written from heart and reaches the heart of readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the simplicity with which the writer has expressed herself. There is a lot to be read between the lines, to be discussed and to ponder upon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there were many grammatical errors which spoiled the wonderful experience of getting connected to the words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proses and quotes are great ideas to be used as prompts if you like to write or want to start the habit of writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/Words-of-Void-by-Sandhiya-Palanisamy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/Words-of-Void-by-Sandhiya-Palanisamy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Watchmaker and Time by Devang Kanavia</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pedro’s love for watches was born out of a strange incident in his childhood.

One fine day, he gets challenged by his granddaughter on the fundamentals of Time. Unable to answer her innocent questions, he realizes that all his life he had been creating watches but had failed to understand what Time was all about.

Will the puzzles of his past ever let him get to the future? Will he ever find out the true essence of Time? Join this watchmaker in his enriching and thought provoking journey in search of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Watchmaker and Time is a beautifully written story which talks about the philosophy of time and eternity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It enlightens us about the complicated questions about time while letting the reader ponder upon what the author has to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is written in a very simplistic manner which makes it easy to understand. It is a very touching story and leaves an impression on the reader for “ETERNITY”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a short read recommended for readers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/the-watchmaker-and-time-by-devang-kanavia/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/the-watchmaker-and-time-by-devang-kanavia/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Anonymous by Nidhi Kukreja</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As I sat down, my eyes rested on the envelope lying on the doormat, For Natasha, the writing on it said. I panicked, this cant is him again! I hurriedly opened it and his words made me cry out loud.” The Anonymous is the story of Natasha, a victim of sexual violence, assault, harassment, and rape, who was a happy, cheerful girl, but she is now cold, heartbroken and weak! During her recovery, she was dragged into a vicious cycle of nightmares by the letters, that just wouldn’t let her move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Dreams are woven and seamed when the bloodsheds”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the path we move on is always not easy; Hurdles, difficulties, issues, problems bring you down, but the inspiration and spirit to go ahead keep you focused and determined. It is not easy, sometimes we get lost and trapped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is she trapped by it? Or is she forced into a cycle of self-harm and depression? Is it a fight to survive? Is there really no escaping the past?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello. Don’t put the book down just yet, pick it. You are welcome to my world.” - The Anonymous&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is very thoughtfully written. The writing style is sophisticated. The transitions from present to past are made very clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plight of a rape victim (read: survivor) was presented with such veracity that it makes the reader feel the pain of Natasha. The letters by The Anonymous cringes the reader as if they themselves have received it. You not only visualise the story, but somewhere in the journey become a part of their story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters were not perfect. No one is. And this is the best part of a book, where everyone’s weaknesses and darksides are shown and worked upon throughout their journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story talks about changes. How some incidents can change lives of people and people themselves. How a friend becomes stranger and strangers become your lifeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the story touched my heart and will remain there forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/10/the-anonymous-by-nidhi-kukreja/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/10/the-anonymous-by-nidhi-kukreja/</guid> </item> <item> <title>PiKu &amp; ViRu by Priyanka Agarwal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A traumatising theft on assignment leaves twenty-eight-year-old content writer Piyanjali Kumari with this crazy epiphany. Her numerous attempts to meet TV heartthrob Vian Rustom go in vain. That’s when her guardian angel tells her the one thing she needs to do to make things happen. Desperate, she takes the plunge. But sh*t keeps going wrong. And PiKu realises her story with ViRu is destined to end in only one way—heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will PiKu be able to win ViRu’s love? Will she get the romance of her dreams? Or will it be the darkest nightmare of her life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PiKu &amp;amp; ViRu is an emotional roller coaster that promises to take you places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story line is very unique. It is presented in a very realistic way. Every person having a crush on a celebrity can very well relate to the emotions of PiKu. Though quite real on PiKu’s part, the story shows the negative side of celebrities through ViRu’s character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way in which the author has been able to present PiKu’s guardian angel as a guide who doesn’t give away much (more like gut feeling and intuition).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple yet compelling. The story is easy to dive into. It is not very predictable and keeps you hooked to know what happens next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>05 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/05/piku-and-viru-by-priyanka-agarwal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/05/piku-and-viru-by-priyanka-agarwal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Perfect Imperfections by Taryn Leigh</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah Lewis desires nothing more than to begin again after a failed marriage and a tragedy so terrifying, it forces her to leave her life in London to stay with her best friend a world apart in South Africa. Despite immediate success in her business, she struggles to understand who she really is and where she belongs in the world. So begins a journey of discovery as Sarah re-unites with Katy in the land where she was born, where the air is lavender scented, and weekends are spent cycling on the beach.Until the day when she has to return to London to face the ghosts of her past and confront a situation that has grown more complicated in her absence.Perfect Imperfections is an intriguing tale which hints at wrongdoings and deceit without giving too much away. The author cleverly weaves a tale around fragile yet strong Sarah as she tries to reconcile her past with her future, engaging the reader to the point where we simply want the best for her and for happiness finally to come her way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect Imperfections is a very easy going story. Though slow in the beginning, it grabs your interest midway and never disappoints. It is not a book with surprising twists and turns. It is very predictable, but the cute moments in the book are what keeps you going.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story seems very realistic. The struggles as well as the reactions to situations are mostly very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are very likely and I would love to have them as friends in real life. They are supportive to each other and gives true friendship goals. Character Development is very beautifully done especially for Sarah. Though she is left heart broken due to her past she comes out stronger with much more determination and sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is smooth and very easy to get into.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended for a light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/03/Perfect-Imperfections-by-Taryn-Leigh/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/03/Perfect-Imperfections-by-Taryn-Leigh/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Living for Today by V.

They blemished all that was beautiful in my world, tainting and tarnishing even the simplest of memories. Deep-rooted. Lingering. …Unseen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emily Dixon knew what it was like to bury a secret deep within her innermost soul. There, its power was removed. Confined. Ignored. All remained hidden until Emily travelled seven thousand miles across the world and unexpectedly collided with Austin McKenna… The very man who blew both her secrets and heart out of the water while trying to piece her back together again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Living For Today is a story written with the perspective of Emily, who travels from her home in New Zealand to her friend’s in San Francisco to celebrate Thanksgiving, where she meets Austin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And then love happens at the most unexpected place with the most unexpected person.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Emily and Austin have had a fair share of a bad past. But they both open up to each other in a way neither could have in front of anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is cute young adult romance and an easy going story. It has a lot of mushy moments which I don’t usually enjoy, but I actually enjoyed this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very elegantly written book.

But they aren’t your regular over-achieving teens. They’re DNA duplicates, and these “similars” are joining the class alongside their originals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Similars are all anyone can talk about. Who are they? What are the odds that all of them would be Darkwood students? And who is the madman who broke the law to create them? Emmaline Chance could care less. Her best friend, Oliver, died over the summer and it’s all she can do to get through each day without him. Then she comes face-to-heartbreaking-face with Levi, Oliver’s exact DNA copy and one of the Similars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emma wants nothing to do with the Similars, but she keeps getting pulled deeper into their world. She can’t escape the dark truths about them or her prestigious school. No one can be trusted, not even the boy she is falling for with Oliver’s face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Six clones. One elite boarding school. Countless deadly secret.” The plot of the novel is very intimidating. It is quite new and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about an “accidental” experiment where DNA of six new born babies were taken (read: stolen) and used to make their clones. These clones (the Similars) were bought up on a man-made island by Augustus Gravelle. The Similars joined the same school as their originals (Darkwood Academy) which led to anti-similars and pro-similars group formation .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story spoke of acceptance, friendship, love and loneliness in a beautiful way. The story was excellent and it unfolded in a very structured manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there were a lot of drawbacks. The same facts were repeated over and over making it boring sometimes. (But it was also helpful a few times since you didn’t have to turn pages to understand references) On the other hand enough reasons or facts were not provided for important events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist – Emmaline Chance was a really dumb character who did the all the correct things only because (a) she is the protagonist and (b) the author knows what she is supposed to do. Some wrong decisions made by a character makes it more realistic. Which was not the case with Emmaline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was abrupt and kept me hanging on several points. I can only wish that the novel has a sequel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/27/The-Similars-by-Rebecca-Hanover/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/27/The-Similars-by-Rebecca-Hanover/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Lake Beneath the Station by Multiple Authors</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lake Beneath the Station is a collection of stories that is sure to send shivers down your spine and give you sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In these tales of love gone mad and ghostly romance, you will encounter characters that frighten yet enchant you.

Although most of the stories revolve around ghostly and paranormal plots, they are not scary. Instead they can be called goofy.(Recommended for weak hearted :-P )&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best part about this collection of stories is that even though they are simplistically written, each story unfolds unpredictabily. These stories are suitable for all ages. It is a short and light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would really recommend this book to everyone, especially the language learners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/24/The-Lake-Beneath-the-Station/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/24/The-Lake-Beneath-the-Station/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Diary on the Fifth Floor by Raisha Lalwani</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A woman leaves her infant at home but finds her on a busy street in an unexpected turn of events. Another woman wakes up in a flight hours later, befuddled, in the strangest circumstance. A fascinating tale of a twenty-five-year-old woman that takes hold of us from the moment she enters the fifth floor of a hospital; more precisely, the psychiatric ward. Visibly terrified, she clutches at her clothbound diary, caught in the horns of a terrible dilemma—whether or not to hand over the diary to the doctor. She fears that she will be declared insane if her tangled web of thoughts unspooling in dark mysterious stories is read by the dissecting eye of a doctor. What does this diary contain? As the novel progresses, we are drawn into characters and stories that are toe-curling, strange, and haunting in their raw intensity. What is the story of this woman? What secrets lie in the pages of her diary? And most importantly, what happens on the fifth floor?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Diary on the Fifth Floor is a story about a young lady Savannah Khanna who is visiting a psychiatrist. Savannah is initially reluctant to see one but gradually open ups to the doctor and shows her the diary in which she writes shorts stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These entries emphasises on the negative side of the society. Breakups, thefts, murders and abortions are the major topics around which the entries revolve. The diary entries show us a very real face of the society. The face which is usually seen in the newspaper headlines, heard on television as breaking news. The observations made by Savannah or we can say the author (Raisha Lalwani) are critical and brutally honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after several attempts made by the psychiatrist to introduce Savannah to the positive side of world, it is difficult for Savannah to accept the same, owing to her past memories since her childhood. And we can’t blame her for her perspective of world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raisha Lalwani has adopted a really simple yet a mesmerizing style of writing. The stories ends on unpredictable notes and makes you crave for more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way the stories were written. As if questioning the society. Showing a mirror to the society and warning them to stop before the scenario worsens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to give a disclaimer if you are thinking about reading this book. Don’t hope to find positivity in the stories. Doing so will just make you feel worse about the world and the society you live in. Think of the book as a critique, which is finding faults in you, the society and the world and you as an individual need to work on improving yourself and hence the world. “Change begins with you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/18/The-Diary-on-the-Fifth-Floor-by-Raisha-Lalwani/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/18/The-Diary-on-the-Fifth-Floor-by-Raisha-Lalwani/</guid> </item> <item> <title>54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew! by Swati Lodha and Swaraa Lodha</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a tongue in cheek take on things parents should and should not do. It talks about various beliefs, behaviour and biases held by most parents that make them annoying and difficult. So, all you parents out there—be a good sport, pick up this book and see for yourself the heart of a teenager. 54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew! will leave you with one big reason to understand your child, all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew…” The book gets you all excited merely by its title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I had all my reasons listed in my mind about why parents suck, I wanted to know what this mother - daughter duo has to say about parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never knew that the problems I face with my parents are so universal. It was so realistic that at no point I could say that it never happened to me or this is so unrealistic. NEVER.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I found the thoughts haphazardly written but I grew used to the style which was actually very interesting to read. The analogies were apt and again, relatable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always felt closest to my sister in my entire social circle. We argue and we fight but we share our deepest concerns, our worries, thoughts and ideas with each other. And reading this book was like just another of our discussions where we speak, we listen, we understand and never judge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book made me cry and it made me laugh. It made me hate my parents and it made me love them more. It was a rollercoaster ride in true terms tantalized by the idea of perfect parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well! Nobody is perfect. Neither are we nor are our parents. Only if we both realise our weaknesses, we have a scope for improvement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading the book you just have two options in front of you Confront your parents and improve your relations Pick the smallest of their issues, argue and worsen your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1st option is not an easy one. It will take time. But will definitely keep your family happier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/16/54-reasons-why-parents-suck-and-Phew-by-Swati-Lodha-and-Swaraa-Lodha/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/16/54-reasons-why-parents-suck-and-Phew-by-Swati-Lodha-and-Swaraa-Lodha/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Faith's Eternal Sunshine by Aashish Gupta</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP YOUR FAITH IF YOU WERE TRAPPED FOREVER?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manjiri, a devout atheist, is meeting her friend Manu after 20 years. Their conversation soon turns into an argument over God’s existence, and its nature. What seemed to be a harmless debate becomes Manjiri’s worst nightmare when she is trapped by Manu in a cell. Are Manu’s intentions malign or is this some weird test of faith? Take a seat, buckle your belt, as you set yourself on the world’s most claustrophobic, yet enlightening, journey of Manjiri. Be prepared to see life in a radically different way with this bold, edge of the seat thriller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faith’s Eternal Sunshine is an interesting story that questions the existence of God but also explains the existence of a Higher Power. It preaches faith rather than religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is a much more practical and realistic version of “The Secrets” by Rhonda Byrne.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faith’s Eternal Sunshine teaches us the following lesson through the medium of a story of Manjiri and Manu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) Happiness comes with pain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can never savour the taste of happiness until you have tasted pain. Seeing the pain of others we realise how fortunate we are for not being in that situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) Certainity of death makes relationships stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I knew someone is immortal and will stay as it is forever, I will start getting envious of it. Our relationship will start degrading to an extent that I will have nothing but hatred for that person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Death is end. But endings are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Life is good with all its colours, black and white, joys and sorrows, but until the artwork is finished no one applauds. Death was that final stroke on canvas.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Have faith in the Higher Power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Believe in the existence of that power from the core of your heart. You need to realise that the Higher Power wants your well being and everything happens for a reason. Be grateful for every little thing you have in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5) Miracle happens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is that miracles are mostly small, sometimes so infinitely small that they pass unobserved. A miracle could be as small as triggering something that may not fulfil the wish of a believer but makes them stronger in the path of fulfilling that wish.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(And I believe it because I have experienced it personally.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Checkout the story of miracle in my life here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do miracles happen? by Falguni Jain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of learnings in this novel. Every sentence has a deeper meaning which has to be read, understood and applied to one’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some grammatical errors, otherwise it no doubt deserves a 5-on-5 rating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Nov 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/15/Faiths-Eternal-Sunshine-by-Aashish-Gupta/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/15/Faiths-Eternal-Sunshine-by-Aashish-Gupta/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Chasing Ivy by S.J. Sylvis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I had a best friend with sky-blue eyes, purposefully messy brown hair, and a body that made every single girl drool on sight. I would know—it drove me absolutely crazy…until I was the one doing the drooling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our days were filled with stomach-hurting laughter accompanied by easy conversation, and our nights were filled with secret, awkward teenage flirting. But that was when Dawson was just my best friend. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then… it was more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a memory I pretend to see through blurry eyes, hazed by passing years of no communication. The one night that my heart was suddenly soaring through the starry night, only to catch fire as it rapidly descended seconds later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years was a long time to get my heart under control. A lot has changed, and yet here I am, still drooling over Dawson—my ex best friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a typical teenage romance. Ivy and Dawson are best friends but deep inside they know they love each other more than just as best friends. They do not want to accept it because they are scared that they might lose their friendship as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is very innocent and characters cute. Ivy is a strong girl. She has grown beyond her age because of the happenings that took place in her life. Dawson though is a perfect lover but becomes quite obsessive about ivy sometimes. But it is cute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the plot simple and predictable. But the writing style was good. It was funny and enjoyable. But at various points I felt lack of emotions. The characters ‘chuckled’ and ‘laughed’ at serious moments, when they should have been crying or yelling at other. This took away the power of the scene and made it look bland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt mixed emotions while reading the book. Sometimes I was laughing like a mad person while at other times I was literally yelling in my mind “Can you guys just stop laughing till you sort your issues?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend it for a light mushy romance read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Nov 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/09/chasing-ivy-by-sj-sylvis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/09/chasing-ivy-by-sj-sylvis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Once Upon A Time by Saurav Chhawchharia</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loving is never easy. No, not loving your girlfriend. That’s easy. But loving your dreams when you have nothing and are losing from everywhere.One moment, everything seems to be going so good, so apt, so right. Another, everything vanishes into thin air. And that, my friend, is horrifying!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samar Kaushik, a daydreamer and a nerdish high-school guy pens a novel based partly on his own past life and partly on his fancies, portraying himself as a celebrated writer having a gorgeous girlfriend and bundles of bucks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sahil is fifteen, sells toys at traffic signals and throws hard questions on the utility of surnames and the education system. Rizwan who serves cutting chai at squares dreams of becoming a footballer. Abdul is contented with life and is thankful that a folk has volunteered to teach them how to operate a computer when comes a day to put everything to an end and they realize that dreams can’t replicate each and everything like they do in those motivational stories and there are some constrains which poverty lays for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is inscribed in their destiny? Will anyone win at their dreams? If yes, who?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is intense yet light, dark but witty, deep yet funny. One that brings out a heartbreaking conflict between our expectations from life and its unpleasant reality on one hand, whereas on the other, also advocates its beautiful side beyond the deceptive world of fake relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once Upon A Time is a beautiful story focusing on lifestyle of slum dwellers. It also talks about the struggles of aspiring writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the concepts were nice the story could have been made into two different stories instead of one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were stories within these two major stories. Grandmother’s stories as well as the story of two different novels by two different characters. Initially I thought that the writer won’t be able to do justice to the plot, but I must say that the plot was very clear and the stories were distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some characters who were introduced but vanished suddenly and entered again later with no clear background about their time during that period. It was difficult to keep an eye on the activities of each character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some places I felt like the thoughts of the writer were not organised. A very haphazard description of events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not a story where you expect a happy or a conclusive ending. You are just a viewer of the lives of the characters, whose lives continues even after the story ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story could have been much better but there were lot of speed breakers in this journey. I must say that the author adopted a difficult way of writing and tried to give full justice to all characters, but there were some noticeable faults which hindered my reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having said that, I feel being a debut author, and trying something like this is tough. I hope and feel that the author will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/29/Once-Upon-A-Time-by-Saurav-Chhawchharia/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/29/Once-Upon-A-Time-by-Saurav-Chhawchharia/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Island of the Day Before by Zuni Chopra</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can conveniently say that this is one of the best collection of short stories I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very different perspective of basic things has been put in front. Thoughts which are merely thoughts for us are beautifully expressed through words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe things as simple as a tree, clouds or an old woman could be described in such words as done by Zuni Chopra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being just 17 year old, the view that the writer has about the world makes me believe that the world is a piece of art. All it needs is a person with an eye for that art.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuni Chopra talks about everything - war, old age, ghosts, life, island, sea and what not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though I loved reading each page and every word of the book but my favourite stories are H.A.U.N.T.E.D. and The Little Matchstick Girl. These are kind of stories you would love to read to kids as much as you would love to read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are a reader or not, this book is definitely recommended!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/28/the-island-of-the-day-before-by-zuni-chopra/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/28/the-island-of-the-day-before-by-zuni-chopra/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Imperial Alchemist by A. H. Wang</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;UA legend buried for 2000 years. A woman compelled to uncover the truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;210 BCE, CHINA. The most powerful emperor China has ever known is on the brink of death. In desperation, he sends his most gifted alchemist and sorcerer on a quest for the mythical elixir of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His fleet never returned….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOW, world-renowned archaeologist Georgia Lee is compelled to hunt for a mysterious man who may hold the secret to the greatest discovery in human history. Her search takes her on a thrilling journey from an ancient tomb in China, through traditional Japan, to the blistering Australian outback, and the dizzying heights of verdant mountains in tropical Taiwan. But what begins as an investigation into an archaeological riddle turns into something very sinister. Georgia starts to suspect that perhaps she is the one being hunted instead….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meticulously researched, this is a tale interwoven with rich historical facts to recreate all the drama, intrigue and mystery of East Asian culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if someone tells you that there exists elixir somewhere in the world, making the person immortal who drinks it. Would you believe it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Imperial Alchemist takes you on one such adventure trip. Georgia, an archaeologist is assigned the task of finding the elixir by a business tycoon Mr. Lambert. The task is much difficult then it seems and much twisted then you would expect. Georgia who first thinks it is just an unrealistic demand of a copious businessman, soon realises it is well planned conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story takes place in China, Japan and Taiwan. It unfolds beautifully, disclosing right amount of information at right time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is part historical, part mythical, and part legend, and many of its characters are based on actual historical figures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though it contains lot of historical content but it never seems boring. The author has clearly done a detailed research about each and everything related to Qin Dynasty, Hsu Fu and the places where the story takes place. The writing style is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development is really interesting. They are very realistic. Every character gets it’s fair share of role in the story. You feel emotionally connected to them even if that character has no present existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story ends with decent amount of lose ends to be caught up within the sequel. I couldn’t stop myself from finishing the book. Neither did I want it to get over so soon. Desperately waiting for the release of the sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you like to read history, mystery, adventure or thriller then this book is definitely for you. Even if you are not very keen about these genres then this is the book which will make you a fan of these genres. (I am was not a history enthusiast either.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/25/the-imperial-alchemist-by-ah-wang/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/25/the-imperial-alchemist-by-ah-wang/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Unlocked Silences by Mukhpreet Khurana</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlocked Silences is a collection of abstracts, poems and excerpts written on tissue papers over a couple of years. It is a dive deep into the circles of emotion, empathy, acceptance, healing and insights into a different perspective towards life. In the voice of a budding adolescent, the book cascades into day-to day-shortcomings, carved into poetry and at the same time, embraces you in silence and stillness of thought. The book is an attempt to connect with the reader, to reflect upon them, unbiased and together and embrace a new beginning. With simplified use of grammar and vocabulary, this book seeks nothing but the companionship of all. With this debut book, the author aims to connect to one and to all in the message and purpose of existence, the aid of spirituality and an ode to a beautiful journey called life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is like a friend who you would go to whenever you are anxious, upset, nervous, happy or excited. A friend whom you can listen to for hours, a friend who can listen you for hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a book you can pick after a tiring day, randomly open a page and read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book isn’t supposed to be rushed through but to be enjoyed one page a time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poems are simple, relatable and heart touching. It covers topics from our everyday lives. Talking about love, life, hardwork, belief and hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though at some places the lines seemed unrelated and didn’t made much sense to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as a whole I really loved the book. It is one of those to be preserved and shared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/21/unlocked-silences-by-mukhpreet-khurana/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/21/unlocked-silences-by-mukhpreet-khurana/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Lucky Ones by Ashley Chegwyn</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too much is an overdose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a mandatory six month hiatus, Hollywood’s favourite It-Girl, Emery Grey, finds herself back in the spotlight she’s trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cameras are still flashing, her mother is bribing her and she’s in a PR relationship with the devil.

This story has it all. It deals with the reality of the rich class. How important can their status and prestige be to them. And how they can cross any limits just to ensure that they are presenting their images as they want to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was so abrupt that I had to turn the pages back and forth to ensure that I didn’t miss anything. It didn’t give any clue for a sequel neither seemed complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I am glad to know that it will have a sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now i am expecting a lot more twists and turns in the next part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/18/the-lucky-ones-by-ashley-chegwyn/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/18/the-lucky-ones-by-ashley-chegwyn/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks.

An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one was my first Agatha Christie read. I have always been excited to read this book and it didn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the book has been written almost a century ago, but it is still equally enticing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A train, a murder, a lot of suspects, all having watertight alibis. Then how did the murder take place under the most impossible conditions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has a strong plot. Although there are a lot of characters, yet each is clearly identifiable. The author has been successful in maintaining suspense till the end. There are a lot of twists which keeps you hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style of Agatha Christie is very clever. It makes you feel like a detective and you try to solve the mystery as one. But you can’t beat Hercule Poirot!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you love to read suspense and mystery, then this one is definitely one of the best recommendations for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/12/murder-on-the-orient-express-by-agatha-christie/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/12/murder-on-the-orient-express-by-agatha-christie/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Secrets by John Callas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the dark genius of wartime Nazi Germany, a secret strategy for world domination has come to the 21st century. A conspiracy too chilling to be believed . . . until it’s unleashed. The son of a hero who gave his life fighting this evil must now take up his father’s mission, and with his beautiful fellow agent meet the shadowy enemy - in the streets, in the frozen Arctic, and in the emptiness of space itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secrets is an emotional rollercoaster with lots of unpredictable twists. It has everything from love and action to humour and terror. It kept me hooked since the initial pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It literally takes you to the moon and back. There are lots of characters in the story which confused me at some points. Nonetheless, it is by far one of the best books I have read this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any further description about the greatness of this book will end up in me giving spoilers. (I would never want to spoil any book for the readers.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some loose ends in the novel making it capable of having a sequel. And the good news is that it is going to have a sequel soon!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/09/Secrets-by-john-callas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/09/Secrets-by-john-callas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Bruised and Broken by Benita A. David</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s Hannah’s second chance at FIRST LOVE. It’s Matthew’s first chance at TRUE LOVE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah has had it rough. Be it her childhood or youth. She fell in love twice. And got her heart broken twice-the second time being the worst. When every last bit of hope was drained, she found herself facing her first love, the guy who hadn’t even really spoken to her and yet managed to disapprove of her love. But when he was extending a hand of care and affection and a possible liking, her past interceded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s an old acquaintance. An acquaintance that developed a crush on him and was eventually turned down by him. 8 years later, here he is staring at her scarred face. She has run away and it was a spur of the moment decision to rescue her and take her to his home. As stupid as anyone would say his decision was, he found it compelling to save her from whatever or whoever she was running from. But who was she running from? And why is he suddenly developing feelings for the one he drove away years back?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s upto Matthew now to find out her fears, mend it and give her new hope. Could he give her a reason to believe again? To love again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story speaks of one of the social issues - domestic violence. As much as we claim gender equality, there are still women undergoing unspeakable torture. This story is about one such woman who could take it no more and has run away. What happens next and how her hopeless life turns around is what this story is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes beauty lies in the simplest of things and Bruised and Broken is one such simple yet beautiful story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah is found by Matthew in a hospital. She is badly bruised and hurt. Matthew wants to help her but is also afraid of the after effects of helping her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story is quite predictable, I loved the way the author has executed it. We see really strong characters and powerful dialogues. The essence and the emotions of the story have been maintained throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each and every character in the story comes out distinctly and leaves its impact on the readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no extravagant romance and action just a simple and a heartfelt story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend it for a light and emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/08/bruised-and-broken-by-benita-david/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/08/bruised-and-broken-by-benita-david/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Changes by Hansel D.

He travels to New Zealand to find a new life, new school, and new friends. He expected his life to change, which did. But sometimes some changes can be haunting. His life has a haunting twist that changes everything. “Where there is happiness, comes a bunch of sadness too,” that’s life. His journey revolves around his new friends and his new lover. In the end, nothing is the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some changes are good while some, are just haunting.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clint, Greg, Nicole and Lexie turn out to be great friends in the school.

She’s been spending her free time at the beach with her best friend Tommy, the epitome of “sexy surfer boy,” and at Waves, a local joint that tourists flock to, mostly female and mostly because Tommy runs the bar. But in an effort to please her father and “do something with her education” she takes a job at prestigious Lake Associates as the assistant to Mr. Lake himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though she’s completely out of her element, far from play-dates and Pampers, she’s determined to handle her new position with total professionalism. That is until she meets her boss’ son Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeremy is terribly good-looking, irresistibly charming, and refreshingly polite. But there are rumors swirling around his recent and mysterious return to the States and the company. No one knows where he’s been, what he’s been doing, or why he suddenly returned. What’s worse is the rumor that he’s been mixing business and pleasure with a handful of female employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite all that, Chris is inexplicably drawn to him. But before she can explore her attraction she has to know the truth, the whole truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is can she handle all the secrets the Lakes are keeping?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about a young woman, Chris who works as a full time nanny. But due to her father’s constant nagging she accepts a corporate job offer of secretary in The Lakes Associates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is doing pretty good till Jeremy Lake enters the scene. He is attractive, muscular and very good natured. Chris is attracted to him but doesn’t want to be engaged with a colleague.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was pretty clueless about how the story is going to unfold by the time I had completed 70-80% of the book. The story seemed nice since the beginning. Talking about friendship, love, attraction, hookups, career, etc. But there was nothing exciting in it. The story seemed to be very bland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time I reached to last few chapters, I was pretty sure that there is a twist waiting. And I was right though not on what it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twist is interesting and not at all predictable. The development of characters is quite good and realistic. They have some flaws but they live up with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is good, though there are some grammatical errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/the-lakes-by-anna-desourdy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/the-lakes-by-anna-desourdy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Is Break Up End of Love? by Sreekara Govinda</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does breakup end the love that is residing deeply inside the heart of a person? Will you get it back if you cry over a split milk? John is crazily in love with gorgeous Priya. They are head over heels in love and share an everlasting bond of togetherness. But, everything changes when he comes to know a life shattering truth about Priya’s best friend. Things get even worse when he gets feelings for a new girl. Does Priya still loves John or has she found a new love for herself? Is John happy with his new love? What is the life shattering truth that he heard? How is it connected with Priya? Why it drove a wedge in blossoming relationship. Is breakup.. End of Love??? is an emotional rollercoaster which shows various phases of love and describes feelings of a person in every stage “&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story about John who finds his love, Priya in his college. But what leads to their breakup? And what happens after that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well the story line is quite predictable. And the writing style seems to follow Chetan Bhagat’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It becomes interesting in the second half. You want to know what happens between this really romantic couple. Though I had imagined few different situations, it turned out to be totally unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good Points 1) Characters are really good. 2) I loved the role of John’s parents. They are friends, guide and mentor to him. 3) The first half of the book can definitely give you some relationship goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bad Points 1) The entire novel just revolves around John’s love interest. 2) Typical “fall in love - have issues - breakup - resolve - patchup” theme is followed 3) There could have been more elements in the story other than love and breakup. 4) There are a lot of grammatical errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story that masses could relate to. There are troubles in every relationship. But if you love someone, you trust them. If there is any miscommunication then you need to clear it together instead of just taking decisions and running away from the problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/is-break-up-end-of-love-by-sreekara-govinda/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/is-break-up-end-of-love-by-sreekara-govinda/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Scavenger by J. L. Willow</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“IT’S NOT SECRETS THAT ARE DANGEROUS. IT’S WHAT SECRETS MAKE PEOPLE DO.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a number of teen drug overdoses disturbs the NYPD, an investigation is quickly formed to uncover the forces behind it. Four people with no previous connection soon find themselves the object of scrutiny as the case moves forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catherine is a freshman living an unfulfilled high school life. After a gentle nudge from her best friend Eve, she begins searching for more. A boy named Samuel may be the answer to what she’s looking for, but not everything is what it seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samuel has connections to the investigation in more ways than Catherine realizes and carries more secrets than he cares to admit. His decision to take a risky bet with a man named Frank seems like easy money but instead causes his life to quickly unravel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank is a drug dealer living in New York City, best known for his heinously addictive strains of laced marijuana. With the NYPD closing in and pressure slowly building, he discovers the life he’s carefully built for himself in danger of collapse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathan Tawallis of the NYPD is lead investigator of the case. Much as he tries to ignore it, long forgotten memories begin to surface and past connections to the drug network quickly become too hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With lives becoming inexorably entangled, The Scavenger weaves a tale of suspense and finding family in unsuspecting places while simultaneously delving into the dangers and alarming nature of the illegal drug trade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Scavenger is a story about drug addiction and the sufferings due to it, directly or indirectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very simple story yet something which needs to be talked about with increasing cases of addiction and overdose of drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has four main characters Catherine, Samuel, Frank and Nathan. They are all somehow involved in drug dealings happening around the town. How is it affecting their lives as well as others. The story doesn’t deal with the fact about who is right and who is wrong. Like in real lives the characters can not be categorised into black and white. They live in the grey in between. The author is trying to convey the situations faced by people involved in drugs through the story. There is everything in this story addiction, death, love, mistakes and redemption. The story makes us realise that everyone does not get a second chance in their life, so make use of the chance you have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a really good novel written finely and in a precise manner. It is a fast paced story and there is no dragging of plot. The beauty of the book increased when I realised that the author is a seventeen year old girl. The maturity with which Julia Willow has dealt with the theme of the story is commendable. There is a need for this level awareness regarding drugs in the youth. A need to know the difference between right and wrong. A need to know the importance of sharing your problems with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some places I felt like there could have been more detailed account of the happenings. Some events occur but cantc leave its impact due to happening of other events. Though it didn’t hold much importance in expression of the main story, it could have given an emotional connectivity and understanding between the character and the reader. The emotional rollercoaster of the story takes slight ups and downs where really steep curves could have occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/25/the-scavenger-by-jl-willow/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/25/the-scavenger-by-jl-willow/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Murder of Crows by Christopher Hoffman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1945, at the end of World War 2, Joseph Stalin did not believe that Adolf Hitler would remain in his bunker and take his own life. Figuring the German Fuhrer was too cocky, egotistical, and narcissistic, it must be a rouse giving him time to escape Berlin. With no confirmable facts provided to the public, Stalin unleashes Mikael his “Fixer” to hunt down and kill a list of escaped, high ranking, dangerous Nazis and their leader. After several years and little luck, the trail was getting cold. Mikael makes a bold move and trades in his team of soldiers for a handpicked band of misfits, each with their own specialty along with a need for redemption. Can this rag tag eccentric group do better than the elite forces that were previously sent on this mission? They will need to, if they intend on changing the course of history as we know it. A Murder of Crows was originally written as a pay television series. The long awaited conversion to novel format has finally arrived. Be sure to check out other books in the Fairchild Mystery-Thriller series where the author blends real life facts with his fictional team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a cleverly written book combining facts with fiction. I liked the concept. Though I am not really a history enthusiast, I did enjoy this story. But I would like to warn the readers of dark and violent content of the story. It contains a lot of scenes of murder and torture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book though written from third person’s perspective very smartly takes up to first person’s perspective while reading through Henry’s journals. The perspective and timezones shifts very neatly from one to another and back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked Abigail and Finn a lot. They are young, smart and wise beyond their years. They solve the mystery started by Abigail’s grandfather and are not scared to follow his footsteps for the sake of justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lot of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Looks like the book wasn’t edited even once. This make the the story a little dull. Had that thing been taken care of, I would have definitely given it 5⭐&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/21/a-murder-of-crows-by-christopher-hoffman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/21/a-murder-of-crows-by-christopher-hoffman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>1984 by George Orwell</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell’s prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. 1984 is still the great modern classic of “negative utopia”—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel’s hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Government (known as The Party) wants to exercise control over everything. All the houses have telescreens, to keep the people constantly under surveillance . What the people do, speak, read, write, eat, drink or even THINK, It wants to monitor everything. Anything which might breed rebellion is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are influenced to act as eyes and ears of The Party since their early ages. Woman are taught to have sex just to produce offsprings and are not supposed to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Party also makes sure that the minds of people are filled with thoughts that It desires. Thinking about anything else is a thoughtcrime and is punishable. For the same reason The Party has created a new language Newspeak, which focuses on translating all the unnecessary words into easier ones. For example ‘bad’ became ungood hence eliminating the word ‘bad’. It also tries to eliminate words which promotes people to think of any kind of thoughtcrime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to The Party, if it says 2+2=5, then it is. No questions asked, no counter arguments made, no logic required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Party has manipulated the minds of people in such a way that they have stopped being affected by how The Party is constantly updating the history as per its choice. They accept everything as if it was always supposed to be that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winston does not want to except this. He is a rebel. He realizes the importance of freedom. Rebels are rare but they exist. But rebellion is something not acceptable by The Party. Whoever tries to rebel is tortured till he/she accepts the principles of the party and start loving and respecting it truly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they threaten you with something - something you can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. And then you say, “Don’t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to So-and-so.” … You WANT it to happen to the other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you care is yourself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the time when The Party can make you do or confess anything it wants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could simply kill the rebels. But hating The Party is a freedom for people which is not bearable by It. So It transforms the rebels. Until they accept that everything that The Party has stated is correct. They generate love for The Party in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end The Party is the only truth. There is nothing after or before It.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel is very thoughtfully written. When we see the media being corrupt and facts being distorted, we acknowledge the importance of truth and freedom. George Orwell shows us our future in a simple yet a heart touching way. And if money and power is started to be used in the way as forecasted by Orwell, it won’t be long enough that it ends the same way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/20/1984-by-george-orwell/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/20/1984-by-george-orwell/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Waking by Matthew Smith</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isabel Sykes, 23, recounts the recent attempt she made to come to terms with the loss of her mother, the acclaimed but psychologically disturbed novelist Marianne Sykes. Marianne died in an unexplained house fire when Isabel was ten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the appearance of Imogen Taylor, an enchanting young woman who wants to write a PhD on her mother’s work, Isabel plunges into the depths of her past and an intense new friendship. After discovering that Imogen is not who she seems to be, Isabel must face the darkest moments from her childhood in order to protect her family from more tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She receives unexpected help from beyond the grave: in the strange, glittering fragments of her mother’s last, unfinished work, ‘Midnightsong’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially the story seems to be a bit vague but as the plot unfolds you start to understand things in a better way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a reader you are at the place of Isabel. Reading this novel is like experiencing her journey yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is ambiguous at various points, as there are few questions which were left unanswered for the readers to make their own interpretations. There is lot of reading between the lines. It is a really different from all other thriller or suspense novels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The suicide of Marianne is the central theme of the book but how everyone has been affected by it and what do they know about it varies from person to person. Love, loss, friendships, different personality traits of characters, decisions made in the spur of the moment but regretting later, mental health issues and inability to know everything are somethings which are very natural. Like our lives the story demands acceptance. We need to accept the things as it is, learn from the experiences and move on. And so is the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has a very beautiful poetic writing style. You can’t have enough of the book. You wish the story to continue even after it is finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/11/the-waking-by-matthew-smith/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/11/the-waking-by-matthew-smith/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Girl With The Green Tinted Hair by Gavin Whyte</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a season for everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Described as, “Moving”, “Uplifting”, and “Enlightening”, The Girl with the Green-Tinted Hair is a spiritual fable about personal growth and about seeing how truly magical life is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a boy finds a girl singing and dancing under his favourite tree he didn’t realise he had been chosen to be the one-off witness to something out of this world. The boy is shown how to live in joy and is reminded of how to pursue his life’s calling. His fear of ageing is overcome and dying is no longer what it seems - all because of the girl with the green-tinted hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this truly comforting tale of wonder and intrigue, which has been called a “hidden gem”, we discover for ourselves how to live in harmony with that which is forever flowing; that which we call life. (&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Girl With Green Tinted Hair is a beautiful and one of the sweetest story I have ever read. After reading the title I was very much expecting it to be a thriller like Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Girl behind the Glass etc. This is what “The Girl” in the title gives you away with the idea of book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I was surprised to see what the book had in store instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story isdivided into 4 chapters which are basically the four seasons in an year - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The writer has very cleverly related a tree in every season to the lifecycle of a human. Spring devotes childhood, summer devotes teenage. Autumn has been related to adulthood while winter to old age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story seems like a song, with every word it touches your heart. I couldn’t have enough of the life lessons shared artfully throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone, from all age groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/the-girl-with-the-green-tinted-hair-by-gavin-whyte/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/the-girl-with-the-green-tinted-hair-by-gavin-whyte/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Forever Disguised by Annie Woods</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erica Lindell would give anything to turn back time. To get a second chance to make the right decisions. To undo the devastating mistake that ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Left heartbroken after the loss of the love of her life, Sasha aka Prince Alexandre, Erica has to find a way to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart and live with the consequences of her actions. But finding the strength to go on with her life is not all she has to contend with. Soon, Erica finds herself in the midst of the evil feuding behind the attack on Sasha and she has to fight to protect herself and all that is near and dear to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amongst all of the confusion, pain and hurt, Tyler proposes a solution that may solve all of her problems. But will Erica go through with Tyler’s crazy scheme?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The much-anticipated second book of the Angelheart Saga Trilogy is another enchanting, heart-wrenching story about the mistakes made in the name of love, full of drama, passion and surprising twists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Continuing from where it left in First Came Forever, once again Annie Woods won my heart with her novel. She has a beautiful writing style.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the way she developed the characters. I have read several books in which I couldn’t love even a single character. But I must say, in this novel each and every person is lovable. (Though there are a few villians as well, as supposed to be in a good fiction).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shasha is a sweetheart as he is in the first book. Even after all the mishappenings with him, he comes back full of life and love for Erica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erica develops from a strong girl to a fierce women through her journey. She deals with her loss and tries to live her life just to fulfill her dreams. She is fighter and a true inspiration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various characters I fell in love with apart from Erica and Shasha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Danny is Erica’s best friend and he has proved it. Though there were some fights and misunderstandings between the two but he stood by her when she needed him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tyler is the characters that I have got a literary crush on. He changes from a cocky and arrogant popular guy of the school to a dedicated lover. Even after knowing that Erica loves Shasha and might never love him the same way, he supports her. He stands by her when no one else even knows the whole truth. He loves her and proves his love for her everytime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miriam, Erica’s best friend from previous school reminds me of my best friend. Who will always question me and make sure I take decisions which I don’t regret later. Who, even though we are not always together will makeup for everything we missed whenever we meet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story had everything from love and action to heartbreaks and suspense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once again the story has some grammatical errors but they can be ignored. The story leaves you at a point where you are waiting for the release of next book desperately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really recommend The Angelheart Saga to those looking for YA Fiction and Romance with some suspense and twists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/forever-disguised-by-annie-woods/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/forever-disguised-by-annie-woods/</guid> </item> <item> <title>First Came Forever by Annie Woods</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backpacking with her high school friends, Erica Lindell’s life takes a thrilling new turn. Meeting the fascinating Sasha Ailes, she can’t help but fall completely and irrevocably in love with him. When he feels the same way about her, Erica finds herself drawn into a fairytale love story that will set her life on a new direction. But Sasha has kept his true identity a secret. Finding out who he really is, Erica must overcome the betrayal and make the hardest choice of her life. Can she give up her own dreams to live in his world, or leave and lose him forever?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First Came Forever is an enchanting, heart-wrenching story about finding true love and the devastating consequences it can lead to. What price is too high to pay, even for love?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the book except for some typos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship of Erica and Shasha is beautifully described. And not only that, I also loved the way how the LGBTQ has been represented in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I didn’t really think that I would enjoy the book because I am not really into romantic or young adult genre. I found it rather slow paced and skipped lot of paragraphs. But to my surprise I was so hooked to it by the end that I couldn’t believe the book was over just yet. It finished on a cliffhanger and now I can’t wait for the release of 2nd part of the series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Well the second book releases on 18th June, 2018.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jun 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/06/03/First-Came-Forever-by-Annie-Woods/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/06/03/First-Came-Forever-by-Annie-Woods/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Behind Closed Doors by B. A. Paris</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You’d like to get to know Grace better. But it’s difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace’s friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn’t Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if a perfect looking marriage is actually a perfect lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about Jack and Grace who are known as the perfect couple amongst their friends. But what happens behind closed doors is something no one can imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack is a brilliant lawyer who defends battered women. He plays a perfect host in social gatherings. He apparenptly loves his wife, Grace and her sister, Millie, who is suffering from downs syndrome&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love Grace, Millie and Esther. They are smart, intelligent and aware of everything happening around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace although has lived in a torturous environment for almost an year, has been able to maintain sanity of her mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Millie is wiser than what people think. She knows that her sister, Grace is in a problem and tries to help her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Esther is smart. She doesn’t takes up thing as they are. She have a curious mind and a kind heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack’s character was a bit bland. Making him villian just for the sake of it. A little more work could be done on developing his character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However I read this book in a day. It was so engaging that I was hooked to it since the first page. The first time I looked up from the novel, I realised I have already completed 50% of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read the last chapter thrice in a hope that their would be something more to it. I couldn’t believe that it got over just yet. I wished it could go on for a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is a dark, disturbing novel. And I would definitely recommend it to you if psychological thriller is your genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 May 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/05/29/behind-closed-doors-by-ba-paris/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/05/29/behind-closed-doors-by-ba-paris/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Turn of the Screw by Henry James</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very young woman’s first job: governess for two weirdly beautiful, strangely distant, oddly silent children, Miles and Flora, at a forlorn estate…An estate haunted by a beckoning evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half-seen figures who glare from dark towers and dusty windows- silent, foul phantoms who, day by day, night by night, come closer, ever closer.

Next morning, a police inspector appears, enquiring about a car that hurtled off a bridge nearby. The girl who was in the vehicle is missing. As the eyes of the hotel-dwellers turn to each other, tragedy strikes again, this time much closer. Can Neelabh and Shakshi escape alive from Infinity? They soon learn that the devils inside them are no less dark than the devils outside. When secrets are peeled off like skin, people bleed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This psychological thriller is about a newlywed couple Neelabh and Sakshi who are trying to run away from a crime they did and end up in Hotel Infinity. The hotel houses Mr Saini (the Manager), Firoz (the Housekeeper), Mr Chand (a painter), Mrs Anthony (an old widow) and their deep dark secrets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neelabh and Sakshi had no idea what mess they are landing themselves in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything is fine until an inspector (Mr Hiten) shows up in the hotel to inquire about a car accident which took place on the highway. The girl who was in the car goes missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds everyone’s dirty secrets are exposed one after the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a dark story involving addiction, murders, dead bodies, blood, rape, sexual assault, torture, abduction, organ theft, necrophilia and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novel is majorly written from the perspective of Neelabh, Sakshi and Firoz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got hooked on the novel from the very first page. The story keeps taking unpredictable twists and turns. Each twist made me go ‘shitshitshitno’. The climax was far from what I was expecting. But then the quality of a good thriller is that it is unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautifully written story, with events happening smoothly one after the other. The pace remains perfect, neither too slow so as to bore you nor too fast so as to miss on important parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this novel to those looking for the psychological thriller genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Mar 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/03/26/the-girl-behind-the-glass-by-sumit-pramanik/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/03/26/the-girl-behind-the-glass-by-sumit-pramanik/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Gabriel Born by Muriel Stockdale</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila Jensen, desperate to invent a genetic cure, defies rules against combining animal and human DNA. She stirs outrage, so her fiancE and boss, Philip Ohl, blames her for the illegal and immoral work, destroying her career. Still, Sheila is motivated; her diagnosis will kill her, so she engineers her last ovum to make a deadly nerve disorder cure. Risking her life, she bears the child, hoping her transferable DNA cure will work, but she can’t find the cure in Gabriel’s DNA. She loses faith; soon her strength and health deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Gabriel grows, her perception shifts. He is a prodigy that wins her wounded heart. She is shocked when he develops perfect blue wings at age five. All he wants to do is fly. Sheila can’t contain him. When he flies, some of each watcher’s consciousness joins him; his audience feels as if they fly too. When video goes viral, devotees flock to watch the angel boy, hoping to join the ecstatic ride. Violent protestors arrive too, spewing vitriol against him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila flees with Gabriel, afraid that Philip will claim her son. When he does so with a court order that shuts Sheila out, she fears for Gabriel. She knows the institution will do anything in the name of research. Gabriel has completely opened her heart, healed her, and given her a taste of unimagined freedom. Clearly, the only way to rescue him is to accept his expanded vision and allow him to teach her how to actually fly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about the mother and son relationship. The mother who tries every possible thing to save his son from getting unwanted attention and the son who’s only wish is to heal his mother and give her a taste of unimagined freedom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is really interesting and kept me hooked from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Feb 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/02/21/gabriel-born-by-muriel-stockdale/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/02/21/gabriel-born-by-muriel-stockdale/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson. Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for the party he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. The press is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life in which – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story as evident from the title is about a hundred-year-old man, Allan Karlson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allan Karlson lives in an Old Age Home. He decides run away from that place on his 100th birthday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story opens in two folds. Firstly in the present, which describes his days after leaving the old age home. The author simultaneously tells us about his past. His entire journey and how he ends up in the Old Age Home. I found the theme of the story very exciting. Events occurring one after the other with new names coming in the picture with almost every chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The flashback part was filled with lots of facts and names of people and places making it difficult to read. But I read it anyways, skipping pages over pages. By the time I reached the end, I realised that there was no link of the past with present until last few chapters (which can also be read without actually knowing the background). It felt like wasting a lot of time in the information which was not really relevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are reading this book and are not interested in knowing the ‘extra facts’ just like me, you can skip the chapters dated before 2005. I hope this suggestion helps and make your reading more pleasurable for this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Jan 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/24/the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared-by-jonas-jonasson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/24/the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared-by-jonas-jonasson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupéry</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel is not really a children’s storybook as the cover may reflect. It is better understood and appreciated by older readers. Although it is not inappropriate for children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrator’s plane accidentally lands in a desert. There he meets The Little Prince. This prince has come from another planet (or you can say an asteroid).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Prince is travelling from planet to planet (asteroid to asteroid) to gain knowledge and ends up reaching Earth because he has been told, “It has a good reputation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their conversation reveals how a child is always inquisitive about everything. It tells us about the human psychology. Human tends to become a more complex character as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that we start to accept as it is, as we grow up. We stop questioning. We assume that there is nothing to learn. But it is not true. Sometimes some questions asked by kids make us ponder about it. But as grown-ups, we ignore their questions and hence their curiosity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author supports his thinking with some beautiful quotes. These words will make you believe in what the author has to convey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;GROWN-UPS LOVE FIGURES… WHEN YOU TELL THEM YOU’VE MADE A NEW FRIEND THEY NEVER ASK YOU “WHAT DOES HIS VOICE SOUND LIKE? WHAT GAMES DOES HE LOVE BEST? DOES HE COLLECT BUTTERFLIES? ” INSTEAD THEY DEMAND “HOW OLD IS HE? HOW MUCH DOES HE WEIGH? HOW MUCH MONEY DOES HIS FATHER MAKE? ” ONLY FROM THESE FIGURES DO THEY THINK THEY HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;―Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author mocks the adult for being interested in quantitative details only. They would not believe something until some figures are attached to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,” they would not be able to get an idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: “I saw a house that cost $20,000.” Then they would exclaim: “Oh, what a pretty house that is!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;IT IS THE TIME YOU HAVE WASTED FOR YOUR ROSE THAT MAKES YOUR ROSE SO IMPORTANT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;―Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the time that you spend on a thing/ person/ task which makes it important for you. You don’t want to let it go away from your life.

It is where he was born and grew up; it’s where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it’s not enough … not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son’s bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Room is a story about the life of a 5-year-old protagonist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist (Jack) and his Ma live in a room where they have no access to the outside world except a television.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an innocent and touching story about the two, their escape plans and life outside the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various instances where the author has successfully maintained the innocence in the character of Jack… Describing Sun as ‘yellow face of God‘. Writing ‘Ma’s other name’ instead of actually writing the other name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautiful story and a definitely recommended for those who are looking for a simple read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jan 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/room-by-emma-donoghue/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/room-by-emma-donoghue/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Who Moved My Cheese By Spencer Johnson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who Moved My Cheese? is a simple parable that reveals profound truths. It is an amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a “Maze” and look for “Cheese” to nourish them and make them happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two are mice named Sniff and Scurry. And two are “Littlepeople”—beings the size of mice who look and act a lot like people. Their names are Hem and Haw.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cheese” is a metaphor for what you want to have in life—whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money, a possession, health, or spiritual peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the “Maze” is where you look for what you want—the organization you work in, or the family or community you live in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change. Eventually, one of them deals with it successfully, and writes what he has learned from his experience on the Maze walls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you come to see “The Handwriting on the Wall,” you can discover for yourself how to deal with change, so that you can enjoy less stress and more success (however you define it) in your work and in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written for all ages, the story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? is a story which tells us the importance of adapting to unexpected changes. Highly recommended in the corporate world by managers, this 90 pages short book can be read, enjoyed and understood by everyone – young or old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautiful parable which teaches us a complicated lesson of life in the simplest way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It reminds us that we should not stop moving. We must always keep pushing, trying new things, and be ready to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the OLD, but on building the NEW.” – Socrates&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So decide which character you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sniff: One who sniffs all the opportunities and threats as they are approaching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scurry: One who scurries into action or take action immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Haw: One who is reluctant to change at first but after seeing no other better alternative decides to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hem: One who is scared of changes and thinks something wrong might happen, hence, doesn’t change at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;some-beautiful-statements-from-the-book&quot;&gt;Some beautiful statements from the book:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Change Happens.

She has good knowledge and sharp eyes to find errors. Her valuable guidance helped me to rewrite boring paragraphs and scenes. She was always ready to listen to my concerns and was ready to do multiple edits, nevertheless, she delivered it on time. She has an excellent command of the English language. I want to thank her for her praiseworthy efforts to improve my book. She has expertise in copy editing, proofreading, and developmental editing. I am looking forward to working with her further in the future. ***- Irshad Ali (Author of While It Was Always Beautiful)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Sugandha-Sinha.jpeg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Sugandha-Sinha&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; Working with Falguni was extremely delightful experience . She was always willing to listen to my concerns and address them. She was approachable and has a really good knowledge. After competing the editing of my book, I can say for sure that under her guidance I could make my manuscript much better. I would definitely recommend anyone seeking an editor for proofreading, copy editing or developmental editing and whenever I write my next book, I am going to come back to her for sure! ***- Sugandha Sinha (Author of Your Life is Poop: But so is Mine)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Lorenzo-DeStefano.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Lorenzo-DeStefano&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; As a western author it has always been my intention to have my novel, “HOUSE BOY”, vetted by a qualified advisor/content editor from inside the South Asian culture in which the story takes place. I believe that writers of the world should be able to explore anything that moves them, which means anything under the sun. But writing about cultures other than our own requires a personal admission of our “outsiderness” and a respect for historical and sociological realities we can only attempt to understand. So I’m all the more pleased with the insightful and attentive work done by Falguni Jain in helping me avoid any cultural or religious missteps in my quest to share the harrowing modern slavery story of young Vijay Pallan. She has helped immeasurably to authenticate my book and to focus its outrage over one of the most pressing issues of our time - human trafficking. ***- Lorezo DeStefano (Author of House Boy)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Harit-Ratna.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Harit-Ratna&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; Falguni has been a delight to work with. She is highly knowledgeable about the intricacies of editing and she is extremely dedicated to her job. She is a fast learner and she was able to pick up abstract philosophical concepts very quickly. Her attention to detail is a key trait that helped in producing this book to desired quality standards. Most significantly, she respects the author’s voice and focuses on maintaining the purity of the vision. ***- Harit Ratna (Author of FAQs on Conscious Growth)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/mannat-gupta.jpeg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Mannat-Gupta&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; I feel very delighted to work with Falguni. She is a very keen person with an eye for detail. She completed everything on time, helped me select and write much better words. For my future projects, I'll not hesitate to reach out to her. I wish her all the best and success in the coming years! ***- Mannat Gupta (Author of Beyond Earth and Sky)*** ___ It has been a great experience. I am so delighted with your work. I appreciate your patience and soft response to my every query. I am very amazed but happy with your fast submission of work. Looking forward to working further in future if I intend to publish other books. Thank you for your support in this journey of one of my dreams. ***- Roohi Noorain (Author of Falling for You)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Megha-Bhauka.jpeg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Megha-Bhauka&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; My journey of editing my book with Falguni was amazing. She has good vision and prepares a step-by-step plan with predetermined milestones while working. She took time with my work and didn't rush things and was still able to deliver the work on time. I hope we will have more opportunities to work together in near future. ***- Megha Bhauka (Author of The Mystery Within Us)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Ashwini-Malhotra.jpeg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Ashwini-Malhotra&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; I have found Falguni very professional and committed to her work. I was impressed with her speed and good grasp to complex subject as “Kala Ghoda: The Game of Power”. She not only understood the characters and plot quickly but suggested few improvements and changes to improve the narration. I will surely recommend her to any of my fellow authors and would look forward to collaborating with her in future too. ***- Ashwini Malhotra (Author of Kala Ghoda Series)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Deanna-Washington.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Deanna-Washington&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Falguni was a delight to work with. I appreciated her command of the English language, her timeliness was incredible, and when I asked for her thoughts and opinions, her input was innovative and relevant.&quot; ***- Deanna Washington (Author of Disneyland Wisdom)*** ___ &quot;My heartfelt appreciation goes to the editor-cum-proof-reader of 'Modern Ved', Falguni Jain. If you find this book a piece of fine literature, credit goes to her. I appreciate her calmness throughout this manuscript.&quot; ***- Amar (Author of Modern Ved)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Harshwardhan-Patil.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;harshwardhan-patil&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;'The beautiful Sky' as a novel means a lot to me, just like every other author. Each one thinks that it is a special and unique one, but while going through the continuous and long routine you skip out the minor details or the mistakes, for that its very important for a professional reviewer. I came across such a very talented person, Falguni Jain (@Bookworm_falguni). She is perfect in her work, and her every fifty-page review through the mail was very awesome. The best part the reviews are very honest, whether the author likes it or not, and that's what real professionalism is. I will recommend the same to the other authors/screenwriters in my friend's circle. Thanks for such a wonderful collaboration. Excited soon to work on the next project.&quot; ***- Harshwardhan Patil (Author of The Beautiful Sky)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Suka-Anne.JPG?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;suka-anne&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;I am so happy with Falguni’s services! Not only is she a wonderful, kind, respectful person but she is professional, prompt, and constructive with her feedback. I will definitely be keeping her in mind for all of my future projects!&quot; ***- Suka Anne (Author of Brushwork)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/nidhi-kukreja.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;nidhi-kukreja&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Falguni is a wonderful person. She is a great supporter. She does her work precisely. She helped me spot the errors when I couldn't see them because of continuously editing the same again and again. A writer can't find mistakes on his own, that's why they need editor so they can polish the work by eliminating errors. Falguni helped me. She told me to make corrections which were left unseen. She did her work honestly. And I am proud of it. I recommend her to my friends and even on the platform where she can get recognition for her honest work.  I am glad we are connected ❣️&quot; ***- Nidhi Kukreja (Author of The Anonymous)*** ___ &quot;Falguni was one of the beta readers for my book and she was very professional at all times. She was great at finding details in the book that needed some more of my attention and always very helpful with questions I had. It was very easy to collaborate with Falguni because she always responded to emails and messages in a timely maner, she also read the book quickly and had comments along the way. I would recommend using her if you are in need for a beta reader.&quot; ***- Karin Dahan (Author of Survive For Me)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/jesse-morgan.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;jesse-morgan&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;I recently had Falguni Jain beta read for my book, and found her to be very friendly, respectful and finished my book in a timely manner. Her assessment was fair, refreshing and detailed. The aspects she pointed out and addressed were unique to her own experience and comprehension. I certainly feel I gained some perspective and help towards my final product by employing her services. I would recommend Falguni for anyone needing a Beta Reader and an excellent source of outside perspective and feedback.&quot; ***- Jesse Morgan (aka BlackMetalRebellion) (Author of Emerald Spade)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/debjeet-mukherjee.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;debjeeet-mukherjee&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Proofreading seems so effortless with Falguni Jain!

Editing is the process of reviewing, revising, and refining a written work before it is published. The goal of editing is to ensure that the work is clear, concise, and free of errors. Editing ensures that the work meets the required standards for publication, and communicates the writer’s intended voice and message in a way that is engaging and easy to understand. **Proofreading** is the process of reviewing written work to detect and correct errors in grammar, spelling, punctuation, and formatting. The goal of proofreading is to ensure that the document is error-free and meets the required standards for publication. **Copyediting** is the process of reviewing written work for clarity, accuracy, and consistency. This includes correcting errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling, as well as improving sentence structure, word choice, and overall flow. The goal of copyediting is to enhance the readability and effectiveness of the written content. **Developmental editing** is a comprehensive process of reviewing written work with a focus on improving its structure, content, and overall effectiveness. This includes assessing the work’s organization, tone, style, and message to help the writer develop their ideas in a clear, concise, and engaging manner. The goal of developmental editing is to enhance the work’s quality and ensure its relevance to the intended audience. ### How can I help you? I help writers by providing personalized guidance, feedback, and support tailored to their specific needs and goals. This includes assessing the work’s structure, organization, tone, and content to ensure that it meets the intended goals and audience. I can also help the writer refine their message, improve their writing skills, and ensure that their work meets the required standards for publication. ### What can you expect in the editing process? My preferred approach is to work collaboratively with the writer to achieve the best possible results. Rather than simply making changes to the manuscript, I prioritize frequent and clear communication throughout the editing process. This allows for a shared understanding of the project goals, scope, and expectations. By working closely with the writer, I can provide guidance and feedback to ensure that the final product reflects their vision while meeting the necessary quality standards. This collaborative approach not only produces better results but also fosters a positive working relationship between the editor and writer. # What is Beta Reading? Beta reading is a process where a manuscript is reviewed to provide feedback and suggestions to the writer. The focus is to provide honest feedback on areas such as plot, characterization, pacing, and overall appeal. Unlike editing, beta reading does not involve correcting grammar, spelling, or other technical errors. Instead, the focus is on the overall reader experience and providing opinions and insights on how the manuscript can be improved. Beta reading can be a valuable tool for writers seeking to refine their work before publication. ### How can I help you? My services offer a comprehensive review of the manuscript, focusing on various aspects such as character development, plot structure, pacing, dialogue, and overall readability. I provide detailed and honest feedback on these elements, as well as identify any other areas that may need attention. By doing so, I aim to help the writer strengthen their story and enhance its impact, ensuring that it reaches its full potential before publication. With my constructive feedback, the writer can refine their work, resolve any inconsistencies or plot holes, and improve the overall quality of their manuscript. ## What do you need to start the editing/beta reading process? To facilitate a smooth editing or beta reading process, it is recommended to have a manuscript and synopsis prepared in the proper format. The manuscript should be formatted in a consistent manner throughout, using a standard font such as Times New Roman with a font size of 12pt. The synopsis, which is a brief summary of the story, should include all relevant information about the plot, characters, and setting, and be limited to less than 2000 words. It is essential to provide as much detail as possible in the synopsis to give an accurate overview of the entire story. &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt; |Focus Areas|Proofreading|Copy Editing|Developmental Editing|Beta Reading| |---|---|---|---|---| |Grammar, Spelling, and Punctuation|Y|Y|Y|| |Consistency|Y|Y|Y|| |Style|Y|Y|Y|| |Accuracy|Y|Y|Y|| |References and Citations|Y|Y|Y|| |Formatting|Y|Y|Y|| |Logic, Clarity, and Flow||Y|Y|| |Consistency in Tone||Y|Y|| |Word Choice||Y|Y|| |Word Reduction, If Necessary||Y|Y|| |Fact Check|||Y|| |Character Development|||Y|Y| |Plot Development|||Y|Y| |Pacing|||Y|Y| |Organisation, Structure, and Support of Statements|||Y|Y| |Sensitivity Reading|||Y|Y| |Constructive Feedback and Suggestions|||Y|Y| |Sensitivity Reading|||Y|| |No. of revisions|1|2|4|-| |For 10,000 words, cost (INR)|₹2,500 onwards|₹4,000 onwards|₹6,500 onwards|₹1,000 onwards| |For 10,000 words, cost (USD)|$40 onwards|$65 onwards|$100 onwards|$20 onwards| *The packages are not exclusive and can be customized to suit the writer’s needs.* ### Book Reviews I offer book review service to help you promote your book.

I am a B.Com (Hons.) graduate from Delhi University, and I'm currently pursuing PG Diploma in Book Publishing from Indira Gandhi National Open University. I'm passionate about books and reading, and I'm deeply invested in helping authors bring their stories to life. I love living in the fantasy world of fiction, and I'm always looking for new and exciting stories to read. I started my Instagram account in 2017 as a way to share bookish quotes that I love. Over time, I began adding book reviews as well, which helped me socialise with various bloggers, authors, and publishers. Now, I collaborate with authors to offer editing, proofreading, story shaping, fact-checking, providing suggestions, and formatting the book to make it print-ready. I'm experienced in working on fiction, self-help books, memoirs, short stories, and academic and religious texts. I'm a firm believer in the power of storytelling and its ability to connect people and break down barriers. I'm deeply invested in creating a positive and inclusive environment that celebrates diverse voices. I'm always looking forward to connecting with authors and readers from all over the world. I'm very excited to read your work and be a part of your publishing journey. </description> <link>https://epeolatry.in/</link> </item> </channel> </rss>
