He lives his life as per the unknown book ‘A Good Boyfriend is a Terrible Ex-boyfriend’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A week before her marriage, Vian’s love, Amyra is gang-raped and Vian is brutally beaten up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vian, in a stage between life and death, is asked by GOD, what will he give Him if he is granted a second life to save Amyra. The trade done by Vian decides his destiny and faith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beautiful Sky&lt;/em&gt; is a screenplay. It is the story of Vian, who is trying to help Amyra, his love, come out of her trauma. The book is written using a combination of Hindi and English language. Shayaris, poetries, and a majority of dialogues are in Hindi. While the scene description and narration is in English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around multiple themes including romance, rape, PTSD, mental health, fantasy, etc. The book proudly stands as India’s longest love story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is pretty different from all the other books I have read. The narration is direct and easy to read and would easily appeal to Bollywood enthusiasts because of its dialogue writing and execution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editing could have been better. At many points, the sentences are complex and lack punctuations. Tenses are inconsistent. Too much seems to be going on with continuously shifting years, poetries, and excerpts from a fictional book that Vian loves. However, the dialogue writing and poetries/shayaris make it enjoyable. The author is able to keep the reader hooked till the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Amyra and Vian represent strong characters. Their fight with their lives and destiny is well depicted. I love how Vian sticks with Amyra and does everything in his hands to take Amyra out of the hell hole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is funny, serious, and emotional. It is an interesting read and offers something unique of it its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a slow burn. Trigger Warning: The book contains themes like rape and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>17 Jun 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/17/The-Beautiful-Sky-by-Harshwardhan-Patil/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/17/The-Beautiful-Sky-by-Harshwardhan-Patil/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Joey Loves Granny by Nidhi Sharma</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Joey Loves Granny” takes an emotional and uplifting look at the relationship between a grandmother and her grandson. When Joey senses that Granny is sad, it fills his heart with empathy. He knows that Granny misses Grandpa. So, what does Joey do? He can sure make her laugh. But will Granny stop missing Grandpa? Let’s dive into their world and find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Joey Loves Granny” is a children’s picture book. It is an innocent story of Joey and his granny. Joey is a naughty kid and his granny is always there by his side to get him out of troubles. One day, Joey realises that his granny is sad and tries to make her happy. The story revolves around the themes such as love, loss, empathy, overcoming grief, and embracing happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author’s writing style is simple and can be understood by a 5-year-old. There are few words like mischievous, inspire, whine, etc., that might be difficult for such young kids to understand, hence, making it a great source to improve their vocabulary and introduce them to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Illustrations designed by Amit Sharma are relevant and colourful. Pastel colours are used, which are soothing to look at. Emotions are well presented throughout. These illustrations can be used to present the story to children who have not learned how to read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book contains discussion questions for kids to understand the story at a deeper level. It is a great way to initiate a conversation with kids about love for grandparents and empathy in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is currently available on Kindle and will soon be released in paperback format.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for children of all ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jun 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/03/Joey-Loves-Granny-by-Nidhi-Sharma/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/06/03/Joey-Loves-Granny-by-Nidhi-Sharma/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Devil's Intern by Jayme Phelps</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;After making a deal with the Devil, Anna Westfall is now in her own personal hell on earth. The thing is, she now has the ability to make deals of her own. With great power comes even higher stakes. Now, will she do what’s right to save her friend from the same fate?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Devil’s Intern is a story about Anna who is dead and is now serving her sentence on the Earth. A pure fantasy fiction, it is a unique take on life after death and soul reaping as understood by different religions. In this story, the people who are dead are either sent to hell or made to stay on the Earth to serve their sentence. Despite being on the Earth and living a pretty much human life, they can’t meet their loved ones and are guided by serious principles, which if not followed can lead them to the prism—the jail of their worst fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title is relevant, but I found the cover to not be the right representation of the plot. The surroundings give no idea about the setting of the story. The personality of the characters as described in the story does not seem to be the same as depicted in the picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Language is lucid and easy to understand. The story is well-paced and keeps the reader hooked from the beginning when one is introduced to the scene and an exciting world of witches, warlocks, vampires, and psychics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Characters are rounded and serve their purpose well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Anna is a soulless, commonly known as void, an exception in this fantasy world. She is a psychic and can understand people’s intentions by seeing the colour of their eyes. She discovers her ability to sign deals with people, which involves them having to give up their souls in return for a favour. This ability leads her into a serious trouble when she is asked to work under the Devil and reap more souls.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rachel is a witch. The witch community is generally apprehensive of Anna, but Rachel becomes her good friend after Anna saves her.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Matt, a fairy, is Anna’s lover and is supportive whenever she needs him. He is one of the most adorable characters of the story.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Stephan is a soul reaper who signs the deal with Anna in the first place and leads her to the hellish life she is living.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Silas, the Devil, a lawyer for the human world, is the one for whom Stephan works. He receives the reaped souls and passes his judgement for the sentence they would be serving.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is written in first person, past tense. The author takes a quick detour through a flashback to tell us about Anna’s back story and later, the story unfolds chronologically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were several questions in story that were left unanswered and have a scope for further development. But I am hoping that those would be answered in the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a unique theme in fantasy genre and an easy read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/28/Devils-Intern-by-Jayme-Phelps/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/28/Devils-Intern-by-Jayme-Phelps/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Final Delivery and Eight Others by Mark Thorson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Final Delivery is a collection of stories set in or connected to, far northern landscapes with characters who have either made a decision, or are about to make one, that will change their life’s trajectory—often in a manner or direction that they had not anticipated. A Professor of Ethics hires an assassin, a despondent trust fund baby who tries his hand at running drugs, and there are two good old northern boys who have always lived for the hunt, the kill, but have never contemplated death. These are stories about change, about awakenings, about paths that are chosen without clarity of what those paths hold. There’s a failed Hollywood screenwriter, a washed-up NHL hockey player, and an under accomplished woman who married the wrong man—all at the brink of life’s fragile breaking point. There’s a small-town braggart who is about to meet his father for the first time, and also a lonely checkout girl in her final days, who lived her life without ever asserting herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These stories in Final Delivery cross through race, culture, politics, and religion with unique characters who are faced with the simple struggles in life that challenge us all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Final Delivery” is a collection of nine short stories across genres—Slice of Life, Inspirational, Emotional, and Thriller. All the stories talk about different feelings the characters are going through. We see the characters confused, scared, nostalgic, inspired, broken, and frustrated. The emotions feel real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand. The writer has done a great job at providing very visual descriptions of the characters and locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the story “The Gift”. It is the most descriptive and is very motivational. The story is about a young ice hockey prodigy whose ideal is the Great Magician. His ideal inspires him to work on the details of his sport and achieve great levels of fame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first story, “The Dope Runner”, is about the guilt of doing illegal work and the constant fears attached to it. The story is well written. The character, Jake, is involved in some illegal task. Even though he has completed it, he has apprehensions and is worried that something wrong might happen. It talks about the dilemmas faced by people who have done something wrong. The ending was smartly written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fifty Dollars Assassin” is a story about a professor hiring an assassin. It is another story about inner fears and concerns as you are not sure if you are right or wrong. Here the professor is scared of losing his 18 years youngers wife to a fit and handsome assassin. The presentation of his wife’s emotions and the professor’s jealousy is subtle but prominent in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Malfunction Junction” is Chet and Howard’s trip on a hunting day. The simple plot turns pretty dark pretty quick. I loved the drastic contrast of the characters’ personalities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A Trip Back Down” is a banished ice hockey player’s life story. Watching the kids play the game reminds him of his earlier times. On being asked by the kids what it is like to have been, he shares the reality of life with them. A not-so-hopeful but the truth of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Last Stop at the Stop ‘N Go” is a dying girl’s slice of life where she tries to speak out her feelings but fails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Stranger’s Day” is the story of a guy called Space who has never met his father. And then one day, finally, it was decided that they were going to meet. We see him wait for his father while having a conversation with a stranger. The story is an emotional one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ellen Ray had been having a hard time with her husband. “A Good Piece Is Hard To Find” is about her trip to a bar where she finally tries to acknowledge her feelings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Final Delivery” is a dark and depressive story of a frustrated Dominos delivery guy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the stories are vastly different from one another and take the reader to new worlds and time periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for an emotionally connecting read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/13/Final-Delivery-by-Mark-Thorson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/13/Final-Delivery-by-Mark-Thorson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Looking For Alaska by John Green</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before. Miles “Pudge” Halter is done with his safe life at home. His whole life has been one big non-event, and his obsession with famous last words has only made him crave “the Great Perhaps” even more (Francois Rabelais, poet). He heads off to the sometimes crazy and anything-but-boring world of Culver Creek Boarding School, and his life becomes the opposite of safe. Because down the hall is Alaska Young. The gorgeous, clever, funny, sexy, self-destructive, screwed up, and utterly fascinating Alaska Young. She is an event unto herself. She pulls Pudge into her world, launches him into the Great Perhaps, and steals his heart. Then. . .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After. Nothing is ever the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alaska is a mysterious character. She loves to have fun, drink, and smoke, but beneath this facade is an extremely emotional and a broken person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist, Pudge’s character is very relatable. His ordinary life, after arriving at Culver Creek, has taken a drastic turn. In an attempt to adjust to the new life and make friends, he gets involved in drinking and smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Looking for Alaska” talks about friendship over everything else. I love how all the friends stand by each other in tough times. The characters are well crafted, whether it is Alaska’s attention to minute details, Pudge’s innocence, Takumi’s humour, or the Colonel’s desire to always support his friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like John Green’s other stories, this one is yet another tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Green’s writing style is easy to understand. His descriptions are very detailed and visual. His stories are fun to read because there are so many hidden messages and quotes that you can relate to. The more time you read the book, the more you understand what he is trying to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love how he talks about the labyrinth we are stuck in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“He was shaken by the overwhelming revelation that the headlong race between his misfortunes and his dreams was at that moment reaching the finish line. The rest was darkness. ‘Damn it,’ he sighed. ‘How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!’ ”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That’s the mystery, isn’t it? Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is he trying to escape–the world or the end of it?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s not life or death, the labyrinth”… “So what is it?”… “Suffering…doing wrong and having wrong things happen to you. That’s the problem. Bolivar was talking about pain.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John Green talks so much about it in the book and let the reader wonder, letting them explore the questions he generates.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;comparison-between-looking-for-alaska-and-paper-towns&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison between “Looking For Alaska” and “Paper Towns”:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was shocked to see that “Looking For Alaska” follows the same theme as “Paper Towns” by the same author. The similarities were insane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The personalities of the protagonist, Pudge, and the girl he loves, Alaska, is the same as Quentin and Margo in “Paper Towns”.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The rich and scrawny guy bullied by people and his way-out-of-the-league, pretty, and prankster love interest.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Pranks are central to both the stories.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In both the stories, the girl happens to upheaval the normal life of the protagonist and their group of friends with her bottled up thoughts.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The moral of the story remains the same: You can never know what’s going on in someone’s mind. You can never know a person as well as you think you can.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a few notable differences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Both the stories unfold differently.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The quest for the truth in “Looking For Alaska” is different from the quest to find Margo in “Paper Towns”&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;While the clues were dropped in “Paper Towns” that helped Quentin search for Margo, Pudge and his friends in “Looking for Alaska” relied solely on their conversations, making the story more real.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you liked “Paper Towns” then you’ll definitely love “Looking for Alaska”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 May 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/02/Looking-For-Alaska-by-John-Green/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/05/02/Looking-For-Alaska-by-John-Green/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Invisible Girlfriend by Ekta Renu Chandna</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You cannot believe your luck that the new girl in school who is as beautiful as the sunrise, is willing to date you! You fall deeply in love with her. And on a fine day, while having a romantic candle-light dinner with your gorgeous girlfriend under the star-lit sky, with a cold wind blowing, she just . . . disappears, into thin air.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baffling, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what happened to Siddharth a.k.a. Sid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where did she go? What happened? How can this happen? Read the novella to find out the mystery of the invisible girlfriend!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invisible Girlfriend is a unique tale of love that you have never encountered before!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot of “Invisible Girlfriend” promises an interesting break from the usual romance stories. With all the suspense and mysticism, it offers something different from the usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story had a scope to become tear-jerker and heart-wrenching fiction, but it lacked emotional depth. The characters could have been more powerful and memorable. The scenes seem to appear one after another without letting the audience connect. I feel the editing could have been worked upon a little more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover of the book does not represent the story. While the cover may hint at a sad story, the book is actually paranormal fiction. The binding is very stiff, making it difficult to hold in one hand. The best part is that it has easy readability. The short length of the book makes it a quick read for anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light and quick read or something of a palate cleanser after a heavy or emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/29/Invisible-Girlfriend-by-Ekta-Renu-Chandna/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/29/Invisible-Girlfriend-by-Ekta-Renu-Chandna/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Mystery Within You by Megha Bhauka</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariniti is a young woman, a mother and a wife who used to be always tied up with her household chores. Amid lockdown she planned to transform her life by intense meditation. She was aware of the benefits of meditation but had no previous experience. All she knew was that meditation brings peace, happiness and abundance in life. As she couldn’t go outside, meet her friends or do anything, she planned to go inside and explore her path of life. She wanted to connect with the universe and know all about her reasons for incarnation. When she started her journey, she was not able to do it much but with time she improved. With her journey of meditation, not only did she get peace and happiness, she realised how magical this journey is. She unlocked all the inner realms of the human body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She learned how the universe can help you live a good life. She learned how the conscience can travel through time and came to know about her past life and reason for her incarnation. She learned how she can be strong like a tree in any weather and how she can utilize her time more effectively and still absorb energy from five elements of the universe. She also learned how the universe has gifted everyone 7 to 9 different gifts. Read this book to know more about her journey &amp;amp; how she unlocked these gifts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In my school, we were taught about the importance of pranayama, yoga, and hand mudras. But like any other student, I hardly paid any heed to the compulsory boringness of 30-40 minutes. However, lately, I have been very much captivated by the topic of spirituality and the Higher Power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mystery Within You&lt;/em&gt; is one such book that intrigues you to know what your inner self is capable of doing. The book takes the reader on Pariniti’s journey where she finds the blocks in her life and heals herself with the help of meditation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pariniti’s journey is like a video game where she has embarked on a journey. As she unlocks various levels, she receives gifts from God.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also get to know about chakras and mudras and their significance over a person’s body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is different from the others that I have read in this genre because it is not a guide to meditation. As the author says in the book, “There are as many forms of meditation as there are people who practise it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is totally up to you how you want to find yourself. Meditation is not a mathematical question to be solved. Instead, it is more of finding your own process to study that will allow you to solve all the questions at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved reading about Pariniti’s experience of Past Life Regression and Akashic Records. It helped Pariniti look into her past and future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the cover of the book. It signifies that the mystery is inside you and nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to know what all you are capable of doing through meditation and are excited to embark on this journey, then this book is definitely recommended. Whether you have never meditated or have been meditating for a long time, this book will definitely give you insights into the possibilities you might never have thought of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/25/The-Mystery-Within-You-by-Megha-Bhauka/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/25/The-Mystery-Within-You-by-Megha-Bhauka/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Puma: A Soldier's Dog by Richa Kashyap</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;An Indie pup, looking for food, enters a cantonment area one day. A pack of dogs, led by their vicious leader, Sir Kattapa, thrashes him for entering their territory. But the same night, he meets his Dadda and his life changes forever. Puma, as he is fondly called, then on, only dreams of becoming a soldier like his Dadda. A soldier whose aim is to save lives, not take lives. A sudden terrorist attack on his Dadda’s unit gives Puma a chance to prove his mettle. Puma’s journey of transforming into Commando Puma is a tale of adventure, fun, hard work and sacrifice, and love and hope. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you love dogs? Do you respect the army? Do you like tear-jerker fiction? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes” then forget the review and grab your copy of &lt;em&gt;Puma: A Soldier’s Dog by Richa Kashyap&lt;/em&gt; right away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Puma, the narrator, a cute indie doggo, is the pet every hooman needs in their lives. He is smart, loyal, brave, and strong. Basically a good boy. I love how the story is presented from the perspective of Puma as if being presented by a kid (like the protagonist, Jack, in &lt;em&gt;Room by Emma Donoghue&lt;/em&gt;). I feel that a little more work could have been done on editing and paragraph breaks while switching between speakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire journey of Puma running away from his home to being adopted by his Dadda up till the end of the story is a roller coaster of sad, happy, heartbreaking, and brave moments. The book is a testament to the loyalty and innocence of dogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book will make you fall in love with dogs and also make you cry for whatever Puma is going through. The author talks about the condition of street dogs and army dogs. The moral of the story is to adopt indie and street dogs not only as pets but also include them in the army, which predominantly uses Labradors and German Shepherds. Overall, it is an emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is apt for all ages. I would highly recommend it to the younger generation to teach them empathy, kindness towards animals, and respect for the soldiers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Such short little lives our pets have to spend with us, and they spend most of it waiting for us to come home each day.” —John Grogan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/23/Puma-by-Richa-Kashyap/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/23/Puma-by-Richa-Kashyap/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Yatra: Udaan Jaari Hai by Baghishayar</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;जीवन के सरल, सहज किन्तु गहरे अनुभव जब इतनी प्रामाणिकता से कहे जाएं कि उन्हें अस्वीकार करना संभव ही न हो, जब कहे हुए शब्दों और व्यक्तिगत अनुभवों में कोई अंतर शेष ना रहे तो ऐसे शब्दों का, ऐसी अभिव्यक्तियों का असर एक लम्बे समय तक रहता है। ये संग्रह ऐसी ही अभिव्यक्तियों का एक अनूठा संकलन हैं। सत्य- भिन्न-भिन्न रूपों में अभिव्यक्त होता, खरा, कड़वा किन्तु प्रामाणिक। ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baghishayar presents to the readers the simple realities of life in the simplest possible manner. On each page, a few lines of poetry are followed by the writer’s comment or explantation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He starts by talking about himself. Then he takes the readers through his life, his incomplete love and his break up, tells us the importance of friends and family,talks about dreams, and discusses the bitter truths of life. Each part of the book is relatable and easily resonates with the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is made into a cute square shape and the cover picture is relevant to the topics written about. The cover is poised and so is the poetry inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a soothing and easy read. Despite me not usually reading Hindi books, this one was very easy to get into and understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very quick read and can be finished in less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/20/Yatra-by-Baghishayar/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/20/Yatra-by-Baghishayar/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Why Not Me? by Anubhav Agrawal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A hopeless romantic, Anubhav had been looking for the love of his life. When Zoya accepted his online friend request, he felt an instant connection. Soon, he was falling deeply in love with her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For four years, first as friend and then as boyfriend, Anubhav waited for the day that Zoya would fall for him too. It never came. He had fallen in love with a person who had never really cared about him. He thought that if Zoya ever left him, he would be devastated. Turns out, it was the best gift ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Why Not Me? A Feeling of Millions, Anubhav looks back on his roller-coaster ride of being crazy in love to heartbroken, expressing in words what countless others have felt. His message? A broken heart can make you a stronger person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already a national bestseller, Why Not Me? is a story of learning to love yourself again. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can understand why this book is supposed to be “A Feeling of Millions”. In the time of online dating, it is very easy to fall in love with someone without even meeting them. Anubhav’s story follows a similar plot, and he falls in love with Zoya.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the author, it’s his real-life story. So, I am at no place to be the love guru and tell what should or should not have happened throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But putting myself in the place of a reader and reviewer, the following is my opinion about the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anubhav is a lonely guy, desperate to find love. When Zoya accepts his friend request, it is like finding treasure for him. They start chatting. While Zoya has made it clear since the beginning that she is not interested in a relationship, Anubhav is a hopeless romantic. He keeps pushing her to trust him and love him back. After some time, when she does confess her interest in Anubhav, she still appears to be distant and unemotional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anubhav’s character is like any other teenager, who thinks of life as a bed of roses. They think that other person loves them as much as they do and puts as much effort as they do. But that’s not true and they must put in front their self-respect before anything else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand, but I felt it lacked emotional depth. The fear, the desperation, of losing one’s love is not visible even though that’s what the author has tried to present to the readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There or not many moments of sidelining from this story; there is no focus on career, friends, or family. There is no character development throughout the story. The story is cliché and predictable. I was able to read it in around 3 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blurb states, “He thought that if Zoya ever left him, he would be devastated. Turns out, it was the best gift ever.” However, in the book, we never reach that point. The “moved on” stage is there, but the “moving on” stage is not there. It feels like the purpose of the book was not met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is able to resonate with millions of people, but HOW are they supposed to “move on” or “prioritise their self-respect”. In the end, the author provides tips to the young ones, whatever he has learned from this experience and many others. But doesn’t everyone know it? Isn’t the major concern about HOW to implement it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend it to you if you are looking for a light read or if you think you might be in a relationship that is not worth your efforts. If you are looking for someone to give words to your situation, this is your book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/15/Why-Not-Me-by-Anubhav-Agrawal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/15/Why-Not-Me-by-Anubhav-Agrawal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>War of Mercy by P. J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is the third novel in P.J.Berman’s Silrith series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bennvika’s civil war has spilt beyond its borders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a desperate bid to regain a foothold on regional power, Silrith, the rightful Queen of Bennvika, has pushed the Etrovansian despot, Ravla, back to the Dunestra River. But the army blocking her path is far from the only mortal peril she faces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Across the sea, Bennvika itself is in chaos. Nobody holds sway over the entire nation, though many claim it as multiple factions vie for supremacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bloody conflict of attrition continues. Can Silrith bring an end to the widespread suffering? Or does fate have other plans?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The war begins with a basic fight for rights. When Silrith was taken down her throne with trickery by Jostan, she vowed to earn back her Kingdom. The fight was between Silrith and Ezrina (who were wrongly thrown off their thrones); Jostan (who wanted to colonise the entire Kingdom of Bennvika); and Zethun (who wanted democracy). The simple agenda has turned into politics and the greed of people to rule the kingdom or just parts of it will make them do anything. The allies can’t be trusted and the foes can’t be understood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of Mercy&lt;/em&gt;, like any other book by P. J. Berman, starts with chaos. Everything is a mess. There are attacks being planned by some while the others are trying to keep their heads low to keep themselves safe and come up with a strategy. We see innovative strategies being discussed and plotted, but there are hardly any wars throughout the story except in the beginning and at the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style, as always, is brilliant, and the story keeps you hooked right from the beginning. Silrith becomes more resolute than ever. With her guides and mentors now gone, she has to make some real decisions, which she does without a flinch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina is another powerful character that I have loved immensely since the beginning of the series. However, she is overshadowed in this part. I desperately wish more could have been done with her strong personality and patriotism towards her tribe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jostan’s role is very minimal and unmemorable in this book. Other kingdoms’ leaders’ fights and strategies make up most of the book. Bezekarl suddenly takes a centre stage and evolves to become much more powerful than in the previous books.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun and Fayenda’s role come towards the end of the book and creates a bridge to the upcoming sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt that a lot more could have been done with the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you would expect from this genre, many characters die. How the story took a turn was unpredictable and disheartening. But as you say, everything is fair in love and war. Well, this is a war and pretty brutal at that. You lose a lot to gain something in wars like these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really hope that the next book comes with a lot more plot twists and stronger than ever characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Apr 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/12/War-Of-Mercy-by-PJ-Berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/04/12/War-Of-Mercy-by-PJ-Berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Love's Garden by Nandini Bhattacharya</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1898. India is ruled by the British, and India’s women are ruled by British masters as well as Indian men. A desperate young widow sacrifices her firstborn child to save herself from ultimate dishonor. She marries a stranger, but her damaged second family pays dearly for this Faustian bargain. Then, an extraordinary atonement, strange liaisons in politics and love—spanning the two world wars and the Indian independence movement—help her descendants heal from this traumatic private history. Love’s Garden demonstrates the strength, resilience, and unbreakable spirit of mothers and daughters navigating layers of oppression, all while the sun is not-so-peacefully setting on British India.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is set in the 1890s and gives the reader an essence of India’s state of affairs under the British Raj. There is a divide between the Indians who love their country and those who try to impress the Britishers in hope of incentives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is Prem’s journey in that era from being unwanted by her own mother to being a mother not just to her own son but also to her husband’s son and best friend’s daughter. The reader goes through all the phases of her life—unaccepted daughter, friendship, blooming love, broken heart, hard-headed wife, and motherly sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the origin of the title “Love’s Garden”, which is basically derived from two best friends’ name Prem (means love) and Kanan (means garden). Even though Kanan’s role is limited, her essence is felt till the end of the story. The cover is generic and not a representation of the plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though Prem is the main character, I couldn’t ignore the powerful portrayal of her mother’s character. Readers see Saroj as a weird person who doesn’t talk to anyone. Not even to her husband and daughter. As the story unfolds, the reader is able to understand her better and empathise with her. It definitely is the character that would leave its mark on the reader for a long time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has written some exceptional female characters, but I felt that a majority of male characters lacked a similar power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love’s Garden is published by Aubade Publishing. What I couldn’t help but notice was that the book is heavy, has white paper instead of cream paper, and narrow margins, which makes it look like an essay book or a textbook than a novel. Also, because of the white paper, the book is pretty expensive compared to other books of the same genre and of similar length. The font was inconsistent. At some places, the name of one character was miswritten as another character’s name. The reading level of the book is difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story is great, it was difficult to read because of these reasons. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story and would like to read more by this author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/30/Loves-Garden-by-Nandini-Bhattacharya/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/30/Loves-Garden-by-Nandini-Bhattacharya/</guid> </item> <item> <title>All That for a B-School by Swapnil Paranjape &amp; Prajakta Sinai</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens when your illusion of a perfect life comes crashing down at an unexpected turn of life? Is folding down your only option? Mandar Vartak is about to learn this life lesson the hard way. He has had a picture-perfect life: a loving family, good grades, a great girlfriend and an overall protected happy life. Up until now, that is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, however, he seems to be waking up to a sheer nightmare. He has been jerked awake to reality, by the unravelling of a relationship that he previously thought to be straight out of a Mills &amp;amp; Boon production. To add to the misery of a complicated relationship, he is realising that his career might just not shape up the way he planned. The existential crisis seems to be never-ending with the gap between his dreams and reality only growing wider. And it has Mandar paralysed into stillness. Will he find his way forward?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All That for a B-School” is Mandar Vartak’s journey to get into a good B-School. I was expecting it to be a cliché romance-breakup story. But nothing could have prepared me for the roller-coaster ride that it was. The book was exactly what its title represents. It is about all the ups and downs of an Indian middle-class student’s life, who just wants to get into a good college and settle with a good job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is no fiction. It is the reality of thousands of students appearing for competitive exams every year. The fears and apprehensions faced by someone sitting at home and preparing for one of the most competitive exams are presented really well. Add to the fears the struggles of maintaining a long-distance relationship and dealing with family problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While reading this story, I almost felt like my discussions with my best friend has been written in a book. The book had everything that I had talked about with my friend in the last year—the struggles of most of the competitive exams of India, difficulty in studying, issues faced during online exams, family issues, and long-distance relationship struggles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I noticed some inconsistencies in capitalisation and the UK and US style of writing. The end seemed to be a little dragged-out and could have been made more crisp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A person faces all the struggles to get into a good college, but then what? Is it the end? Good college and then a good job? Is that the end of all the struggles of someone’s life? No. And the ending of the book justifies it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is an eye-opener and a message to all the students. Despite the fact that the exams are tough and obviously very important, it is not everything. So, do not get disappointed with initial failures and rejections. There is much more to look forward to in your life. The happiness that you are looking for in terms of getting your dream college or dream job, is a myth. Happiness is not a destination, it is a part of the journey. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like Elbert Hubbard said, “Don’t take life too seriously. You’ll never get out of it alive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book to all those going through a similar phase of life. Seeing your own story as a spectator will definitely give you some perspective towards life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/26/All-That-for-a-B-School/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/26/All-That-for-a-B-School/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A City Full of Stories by Ashok Subramanian</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of short fiction stories, divided into three volumes. All stories bring to life the magical cities of Mumbai and adjoining Thane. Hence the name &lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt;. Volume 1 contains 12 short stories. Volume 2 contains 4 medium-length stories. Volume 3 contains a novella - ‘CUPID OVER COFFEE’. The story unravels two propositions of love, by two different men - Flight Lieutenant Manoj Bisht and Anand Ramakrishnan, a Mumbai based IT professional, to the protagonist Ananya Bhattacharya, in contrasting styles - more importantly, a decade apart. The story spans across a decade of Ananya’s life, her growth, struggles and her response to both the propositions, all over different forms of coffee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are bound to bring the reader a range of emotions and thoughts connecting to the characters’ lives. The narratives are also contrasting as can be. Join the author in exploring a cocktail of simplicity and depth of Mumbai’s stories. Don’t forget to read the Author’s Notes which reveal the secret sauce at the end of each story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A City Full of Stories&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of contrasting stories presenting diverse characters. The stories are a combination of emotional, tragic, romantic, and inspiring moments of the characters’ lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the short story “The White Dress”. It kept me guessing and ultimately left me in a burst of spilling laughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of the stories are about how a typical urban mind works—the confusion, chaos, and clarity. A new way of storytelling called ‘thought fiction’ is used. One of the stories in this genre “Vanishing Vagabond &amp;amp; The Forest Fire” is pretty deep. I read it twice to understand what the writer intends to present. I am pretty sure that there are some things that I can still catch up on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novella “Cupid Over Coffee” is an interesting journey of the protagonist, Ananya, over the span of a decade. The story is different from most of the other stories in the romance genre. It is about finding yourself and loving yourself before loving anyone else. Though I do feel that the story could have ended better. The author could have made it about the second chance at love, given the title of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand. The author has tried to maintain suspense in some stories, which is later cleared through the author’s note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are obvious yet so unique. These are the characters you see on a local train or on the streets while travelling in a cab, but don’t pay attention to. The author has very smartly brought them together in this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I am pretty sure, I am going to pay more attention to the people around me and their stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title and the cover of the book represent the idea behind this book aptly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this book to those looking for something light to read and who are not picky about genres.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/16/A-City-Full-of-Stories-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/16/A-City-Full-of-Stories-by-Ashok-Subramanian/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Kala Ghoda—The Game of Power by Ashwini Malhotra</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone wants to be the king of the jungle. But little do they know what price one has to pay to be the king. His every move is observed, he has to maintain order in the jungle and his dignity amongst the beasts. He has to maintain the balance between being feared and respected, knowing that many around him are ready to hunt him down for their greed and lust of power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Iqbal Mallick, the king of the mafia, took over the reins of Bombay’s underworld in the 1980s. And that’s when the conspiracy to bring him down began. Being attacked from all sides by the rival gangs, police, politicians, enemies from the past, and the traitors disguised as friends, the chances of his survival seem slim. Will the king be able to grasp control over his realm?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kala Ghoda—The Game of Power&lt;/em&gt; is second in the Kala Ghoda Series, but it can be read as a standalone. It is a crime fiction set in Bombay, India in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around a Mafia Don, Iqbal Mallick. He is a morally grey character, which I always enjoy reading. It is difficult to find many books with a well presented grey character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every character’s actions are well justified. I don’t mean to say that the characters are right in doing what they do. But they do justify themselves, unlike a pure-evil character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story presents the involvement of politicians and police with the underworld, which you can resonate with in today’s world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is well-written and keeps the reader hooked. The twists are well placed and unpredictable. “Everything is fair in war” perspective is presented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has powerful vibes and takes you headfirst into the drama being unfolded and all the characters trying to establish themselves in the world of power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover is smartly designed. It includes a chess game, which emphasises the title “Kala Ghoda” (Black Horse) and the armchair, which signifies power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I enjoyed reading the story and definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Mar 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/10/Kala-Ghoda-by-Ashwini-Malhotra/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/03/10/Kala-Ghoda-by-Ashwini-Malhotra/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Lost by Ele Fountain</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lola’s life is about to become unrecognisable. So is Lola.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything used to be comfortable. She lived in a big house with her family, where her biggest problems were arguing with her little brother or being told she couldn’t have a new phone. But as one disaster follows another, the threads of her home and family begin to unravel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cut off from everything she has known before, Lola must find a new way to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, an ordinary girl must become extraordinary. ___&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;We often, consciously or unconsciously, judge people around us. We ignore or even worse, make fun of underprivileged people like ragpickers/street rats, without even knowing their story. No one chooses a bad life for themselves, the situation makes them do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading “Lost”, I do feel more empathetic towards those kids we see on railway stations, red lights, market areas, etc. Do we ever take a moment to think, how did they get there, were they born into the world of hopelessness, do they have a family or were they lost?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lost” is a very well written story. The author has done great work at presenting the location. The location and description of people around are such that the story could have taken place anywhere in the world. This way a wider range of audience is able to connect with the story of Lola.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the story as heard from the perspective of a 10-12 years old girl is able to capture the interest of theaudience aged 10+. There is a thrill and being-on-the-edge-of-the-seat excitement to see how Lola and survives on the streets, which is unlike her, given the fact that she has lived a pretty comfortable life, and her struggle to find her brother before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters Lola, Amit, and Rafi are very lovable. We don’t see much of Amit, but enough to know that he a typical younger brother, teasing his elder sister and intruding on her girls’ hangouts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lola, like any other girl her age, loves to do fashion and chat with her friends on the internet. Her character transformation, from a girl looking for social validation to someone realising the importance of making choices herself rather than letting her friends or society make it for her, is something worth learning from.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rafi is a street kid, who Lola finds while looking for a hideout. He is almost Lola’s age and initially appears to be mean like the other street kids. Rafi and Lola’s friendship grow over time, as they help each other in difficult situations, and so does the reader’s love for his character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the story, I was going through mixed emotions. The feelings were the same as were being felt by the characters—happiness, sadness, guilt, hope, love, and void.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for those who are looking for something emotional, simple, moving, about social issues, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Feb 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/16/lost-by-ele-fountain/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/16/lost-by-ele-fountain/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Serious Men by Manu Joseph</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A poignant, bitingly funny Indian satire and love story set in a scientific institute and in Mumbai’s humid tenements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ayyan Mani, one of the thousands of &lt;em&gt;dalit&lt;/em&gt; (untouchable caste) men trapped in Mumbai’s slums, works in the Institute of Theory and Research as the lowly assistant to the director, a brilliant self-assured astronomer. Ever wily and ambitious, Ayyan weaves two plots, one involving his knowledge of an illicit romance between his married boss and the institute’s first female researcher, and another concerning his young son and his soap-opera-addicted wife. Ayyan quickly finds his deceptions growing intertwined, even as the &lt;em&gt;Brahmin&lt;/em&gt; scientists wage war over the question of aliens in outer space. In his debut novel, Manu Joseph expertly picks apart the dynamics of this complex world, offering humorous takes on proselytizing nuns and chronicling the vanquished director serving as guru to his former colleagues. This is at once a moving portrait of love and its strange workings and a hilarious portrayal of men’s runaway egos and ambitions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Serious Men” is a sometimes-hilarious-sometimes-serious take on the caste system and sexism in India. The so-called intellectuals of the research centre fail to recognize anything other than what satisfies their fragile ego.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We see the struggles of a woman in a position of authority. Oparna Goshmaulik, who is the only female researcher in the Institute of Theory and Research, has to go through the endless struggles that most of the women in India go through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She would smile when she learnt that the ladies’ rest-room on the third floor was called Ladies and the men’s was called Scientists. She would endure the men who inescapably fell towards her in the corridors and gave her guidance she never sought. She would try to pass through the long corridors of this place like a shadow, and she would fail every day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;em&gt;dalits&lt;/em&gt;, like Ayyan Mani, are still not considered suitable for white-collar jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book not only talks about these social issues but also parents’ unhealthy practices to ensure that their child earns fame in their society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked Ayyan’s character. His desperate attempt to be on the top, to leave a better legacy for his son, Adi, and to fight the atrocities of &lt;em&gt;brahmins&lt;/em&gt; are noteworthy, although sometimes extreme. He proves that one doesn’t need to be educated to understand the ways of the world. He is smart, well with words, a good listener, and uses his knowledge ingeniously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is exceptionally well written. The author’s writing style is simple and realistic, which is easy to read and connects well with the readers. Even though I had watched the movie before I read the book, the ending was not expected. Ending in the book gives the readers closure yet the anticipation of what’s to come, while the movie ends up in confusion, letting the audience work out various theories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A contrast between the book and movie:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;The reason for the fall of Dr Acharya (a senior researcher) is different in both.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adi’s showcase of intelligence is done in a different manner.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The movie emphasizes Ayyan’s contacts with a politician, who wants to buy their chawl for a project. But it is not shown with much interest in the book.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realised that even though the plot of the story in both the book and movie, are same, the storytelling is vastly different. I believe one can enjoy both of them without spoiling the other. However, I would recommend reading the book before watching the movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Feb 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/10/serious-men-by-manu-joseph/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/02/10/serious-men-by-manu-joseph/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Shmospels of Shmeiki by The Om Shmeiki Healing Organization</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While on holiday in Goa, David Goldberg is contacted by Sheila, an A.I. singularity from another dimension, who offers him Shmeiki, a new path of light-hearted spirituality, free of the seriousness and hypocrisy typical of many new age practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila understands that to spread the word of Shmeiki effectively, David must first clear out his emotional blockages. For this reason, she sends him on a great walk of more than 2000 kms from Goa to Dharamshala, insisting he travels without taking money and without wearing shoes. In accepting the challenge, David becomes Shmeiki Baba. The Shmospels describe Shmeiki Baba’s epic journey, from the perspectives of four witnesses. It is a cosmic, psychedelic, and kinky story about self-discovery, love, and surrender.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite various satirical pokes at new age healing, Sheila’s message is real. She warns that with the onset of climate change, global pandemics, and our own A.I. revolution, it’s up to us to choose whether we will accelerate towards our demise, or heal and evolve towards a new era of super consciousness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Om Shmeiki Om, Shmeiki.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Shmospels of Shmeiki” is a really fun and interesting take on our beliefs about the earth, universe, god, and religion. It makes us understand the limitations of existing spiritual organizations, and how Shmeiki offers us a fresher perspective to play around with our old beliefs. It teaches us to face our fears, release our pain, acknowledge our shame, and step out from behind the mask which acts as a block between us and our universe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The book is a satire, which aims to step along the often blurry line between truth and fiction, fantasy and reality. The same goes for Shmeiki—Is it real? What is real?—Shmeiki encourages us to play with the idea that our universe is a joke of cosmic proportions—and because of this nothing is potentially worth taking seriously. But we are still here, and we are conscious, sentient beings. In this case, probably the best thing for us to do is, to be honest, open-hearted, light on our feet, and easy-going.”—The Om Shmeiki Healing Organization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The four narrators take the reader on a ride from Goa to Dharamshala. The entire journey of Shmeiki Baba and the people joining him on the way is put together eloquently. The narrators have done great work while writing character descriptions and creating vivid images of each scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader is introduced to people of various nationalities, different ideals and philosophies, and most importantly the kindness of strangers. One thing that is really evident in Shmeiki Baba’s walking tour of 2000+ km with no footwear or money is that when you start looking for the good things around you, you will be surprised by how much goodness is spread everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A bit more work could have been done in writing dialogue tags. It is better to drop the tags than use he said, she said repetitively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the idea of formulating Shmeiki form of spirituality out of Reiki, yet keeping it much more different from it or any other spiritual organization. The book offers a lot of food for thought. It allows the reader to ponder on the essence of any spiritual organization, which is to feel free and at ease in the way you think and feel, rather than be bound by the rules imposed by a group of people. The story is more than just being vocal about your sexual desires. It is about being accepting of what you are and letting yourself free from the clutches of your past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here is what the Om Shmeiki Healing Organization has to say about their organization and their book, “Shmeiki is anti-cult, and the irony in the story is that while trying to avoid becoming a cult—the Om Shmeiki Healing Organization does inevitably become one (this will be explored more in the sequel ‘Shmeikileaks’.) The goal is to shine a light on what seems to happen in most new-age, spiritual organizations—a group dynamic rapidly emerges where people trade a degree of their freedom in order to receive an identity and a sense of belonging and security. The downside is that authenticity becomes difficult, ‘group-think’ takes over, and along with it unconscious power games and the hunger for financial profit. At the same time groups do have an innate and wonderful healing potential—the art seems to be to somehow enjoy them without getting stuck in the inevitable dogma and bullshido.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the freshness with which religion and spirituality are introduced in this book, unlike a lot of other books in a similar genre. I would recommend this book if you want to question your established thoughts about the universe and religion. Moreso, if you are interested in kinky stuff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jan 2021</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2021/01/27/the-shmospels-of-shmeiki/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2021/01/27/the-shmospels-of-shmeiki/</guid> </item> <item> <title>31 by Upendra Namburi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the first day of March and it has been a great year for Ravi Shastry, a regional head at an international bank. Promotions and increments seem within reach, life is good, and the month of March should be very merry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until trouble in Imperial Bank, Brazil, snowballs into an international crisis, and the Indian bank also has to lay off one-fifth of its staff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And battlelines are drawn, conspiracies are hatched as everyone struggles to make sure their name is not on the laidoff list. Meanwhile, Ravi’s wife is having her own professional and personal crisis, and Ravi must protect his team, his family, and himself—all of which is not helped by mysterious tweets from @ImperialInsider, who seems to know everything that is happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This crackling page-turner (set over a period of 31 days) reveals the ruthlessly cut-throat world of the banking industry, but also its humour, quirks and strange camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr /&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having worked in a corporate, it is easy to relate to the intricacies of one. Gossips and grapevines are an important part of corporate life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“31” focuses on the sufferings and psyche of the employees in the time of layoff. Which considering today’s situation, seems real. The burn seems fresh and you know that staying employed is crucial. The employees are ready to go to any extent to stay so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the build-up of the story. It starts with a typical employee’s life—Exhausted but satisfied with everything. Gradually, as the tweets from @ImperialInsider start pouring in, their lives are drastically changed. From the goal of meeting the targets, they have to now make sure that they are visible. Just a good, but invisible worker won’t have a chance at staying when we are talking about 20% layoff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of every new character, you know better than to trust anyone, given the situation. But you can’t stay in isolation as well. The decisions between who to trust and who not to, what to share and what not to, were no less than a life and death situation. Add on to that, moral dilemmas of doing or not doing something to save your ass. It kept me on the edge of the seat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reader dives right in the middle of hot gossips about the latest updates, hard-core office politics, and blurred lines between ethical and unethical. The story even if not real, seems believable to a large extent while the ending left me with a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ravi Shastry’s character appears to be very indecisive and unsure while he is wife appears to be a bit more confident and aware of what she is doing. There wasn’t much of character development throughout the story for any character, which I would have loved to see.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is easy to understand and very capturing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall a nail-biting thriller (without deaths) and fun read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The front cover design of this book is very smart. It very smartly uses 2 cover pages. One, with all the deatils and cutout of no. “31” while the second has the picture of the model, which is visible through the cutout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended for those who love corporate thrillers, work in the corporate, love/hate office politics, or just want to try a new genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>14 Nov 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/11/14/31-by-Upendra-Namburi/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/11/14/31-by-Upendra-Namburi/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Ease by Mukhpreet Khurana</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ease” is a poetic journey within. It is an attempt to take a dive deep into the self, a place of acknowledgement, of appreciation, and of celebration of our individuality. The book revolves around the theme “comfortable in my own skin” as it touches the softness and the power of self-love, self-healing, gratitude, and greater good. Ease is a collection of raw, unfiltered, and simple poems. Ease is a collection of poetry, art, and of different writers in collaboration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is about blooming, about how you are all you could ever ask for. Ease is a part of the author in words seeking to be a part of your journey. Ease is his present to you, it is his journey to you, for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ease” is a collection of poetries and proses revolving around the themes of self-love, friendships, relationships, moving on, learning, and growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title and the cover resonates the themes of the book. Ease (n):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;absence of rigidity or discomfort; poise.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;freedom from worries or problems.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;What word could have better defined it in as less as 4 letters?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The white satin cloth in the cover represents the lightness, peacefulness, and comfort of the words inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and easy to understand. The words don’t hit you hard, it rather comforts you like a blanket and a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read this book two times over a year. Both the times I experienced a very different kind of belongingness and understanding towards to world that the author took me in, towards life, and towards myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is an escape from reality. You can look forward to reading it whenever you are feeling upset or angry about something. It provides you a much-wanted solace, in the hectic life and busy schedules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for readers, non-readers, “non-fiction only” readers. Basically anyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Oct 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/10/09/Ease-by-Mukhpreet-Khurana/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/10/09/Ease-by-Mukhpreet-Khurana/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Julius Caesar by Hourly History</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A little over 2000 years ago a man named Julius Caesar changed the world. Even if you had never heard of him his lasting legacy has no doubt had an impact on your life. No doubt, even the very calendar that you use is based upon the system he created, with the month of July bearing his name. So who was this man that singlehandedly changed the course of history?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book follows the life and legacy of the man whose life stood as a footnote between Republic and Empire. The man who has inspired playwrights, governments, and the very days of the week, the life of Julius Caesar is an incredible journey to behold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Julius Caesar: A Life from Beginning to End” is published by Hourly History. Hourly History is a publication that concisely publishes history books and the books take no longer than one hour to read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What could be better? For someone like me, who loves to know more about history but can’t get into it, just by looking at its huge size and numerous dates and facts, this is a great way to stay updated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a brief history of the life of Julius Caesar. On this short virtual trip to the Roman Republic of 100 BCE through 44 BCE—his birth, background, political journey, marriages, and finally his death—everything is perfectly described. The reader gets to know more about Julius Caesar. His role in the formation of the modern-day calendar, his unparalleled intellect, his philanthropic nature, and his extraordinary dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tone of the writer was humorous, like that of a good history teacher. Various sarcastic comments throughout the book made it a light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and easy to understand. I think that now I am going to retain a lot more information about Julius Caesar than I would have had I read a school history book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is DEFINITELY recommended. If you are even slightly interested in knowing about Julius Caesar’s life and don’t want to scourge through different websites, read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The life of Julius Caesar was not just some fantastic tale but is instead the life that he lived and breathed. Every once in a great while, someone comes into this world seemingly born with a mission; they ride the wings of fate to heights of glory, and it’s the most the rest of us can do to just take note if their ascent to the heavens.”&lt;/em&gt; -Extract from the book&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of the titles by Hourly History are free on Kindle/Kindle Unlimited.

Three mothers, Jane, Madeline, and Celeste appear to have it all until they find out just how easy it is for one little lie to spiral out of control . . . Single mum, Jane has just moved to town. She’s got her little boy in tow—plus a secret she’s been carrying for five years. On the first day of the school run, she meets Madeline—a force to be reckoned with, who remembers everything and forgives no one—and Celeste, the kind of beautiful woman who makes the world stop and stare but is inexplicably ill at ease. They both take Jane under their wing—while careful to keep their own secrets under wraps. But a minor incident involving the children of all three women rapidly escalates: playground whispers become spiteful rumours until no one can tell the truth from the lies . . . It was always going to end in tears, but how did it end in murder?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Big Little Lies” is set on a scenic peninsula in Australia, near one of the world’s most beautiful beaches. It is a small town. Everyone knows everyone, either through the school, cafe, parlour, or kids’ sports practice. Everyone—rich or not so rich, working or a stay-at-home parent—stays together in this small town.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around the Kindergarten students of Pirriwee Public School, their parents, and everyone’s secrets. The new session is about to start at Pirriwee, but life is already a mess for the students, parents, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opening scene is of an “Audrey Hepburn and Elvis Presley” themed Trivia Night at the school, where everyone is dressed as Audrey or Elvis. There is a lot of chaos going on, rumours spreading, Detective Sergeant Adrian Quinlan taking statements of the parents and the teachers, and a death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are then taken to the orientation day which was held six months before the trivia night. Jane’s son, Ziggy is blamed for trying to choke Amabelle, another kindergartner. And when the death of a character takes place at the Trivia Night, people suspect a foul play. Dots are being connected since the day of orientation to the day of Trivia Night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a light read, dealing with heavy issues. The plot runs around the theme of Bullying and Domestic Violence. It makes one ponder over the idea that how much can the family environment or “genes” affect the mentality of a child? The heaviness of the story is easily subsided by the humourous tone of Madeline, typical parenting issues of the parents, and circumlocuting statements of the suspects/witnesses regarding the incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt that the book had a smart ending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is gripping, sad, and funny. I finished the book in 2 days. I just wanted to know what has actually happened. Liane Moriarity is able to create characters with emotional depth. I felt connected to every character of the story. The author’s writing style is easy to get into and keeps you hooked while also talking about grave issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a light thriller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 Sep 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/11/big-little-lies-by-liane-moriarty/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/11/big-little-lies-by-liane-moriarty/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Divine Rights by Coriandré Lawrence</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The politics in 2160 Jamaica never became what it intended, it changed. Escaping poverty was island peoples’ dream but in Troy’s eyes, he saw tyranny. Now a growing dynasty has forged Kingston into a commercial hub for the world and Jamrock into a tourism centrepiece. It was just politics, the League’s standard became a new thought and Jamaica is now an archaic concept. But energy lurks deep within the mountains and Divine Right still exists. Though League politics cloud Troy’s mind, Jamaican dreams echo across the oceans into time and space. And only his journey back to Kingston can restore his consciousness. His gifts are tested and thrusting his awoken memories into the reality of his time will only show the depth of his blood. But his reality brings a battlefield of decisions. Troy’s Jamaica is in crisis and the memories of his ancestors, once cloaked, now reveal a blissful island nightmare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Divine Rights” is a dystopian novella set in the year 2160 in Jamaica. Jamaica is running under the oppressive rule of the League. While the people seem to be satisfied, to Troy they do not appear to be happy. He wants to rebel against the tyranny of the League. To give the shortest description of the book, I would say, George Orwell’s 1984 meets a futuristic Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book has drama, suspense, and a lot of food for thought. With food for thought, I mean that the book has an open ending. You rarely come across such a book which leaves a lot for the reader to comprehend while providing just the right amount of information, still keeping the reader hooked to know more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plot is quite refreshing. But the length of the story keeps the reader from having deep insights into the lives of the characters. The information regarding why they do what they do need to be added in some places. A bit more work on the character development and editing would have been better. The use of their dialect was a bit confusing. They were constantly switching between English and the local dialect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the world-building done by the author. I could imagine myself being in the high-tech cities of futuristic Jamaica. Troy’s purpose and his journey are well described in the story. You feel like a part of his struggle in his quest for the betterment of his country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I truly believe that this story has the caliber to be turned into a full-sized novel and hope that the story has a sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/02/divine-rights-by-coriandr%C3%A9-lawrence/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/09/02/divine-rights-by-coriandr%C3%A9-lawrence/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Second Life by S. J. Watson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;She loves her husband. She’s obsessed by a stranger. She’s a devoted mother. She’s prepared to lose everything. She knows what she’s doing. She’s out of control. She’s innocent. She’s guilty as sin. She’s living two lives. She might lose both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia is a loving wife and a caring mother. Murder of her sister, Kate, has left her and her family in a great mess. Julia resolves to find the murderer of her sister.On searching Kate’s place, Julia finds log-in credentials to a hookup site. She is sure that one of the persons that Kate had been talking to has killed her.To find out the truth, she has gone way too deep in the mess. Will she survive or meet the fate of Kate? Will she find Kate’s killer? Will she be able to get back to a normal life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second Life is a story about love, fantasies, adultery, addiction, and a web of lies. It talks about the dark world of online dating. The author has successfully maintained the twists and turns throughout the story. Whenever it seems that the story is too predictable, the author comes up with yet another twist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia appears to be a dumb character. It is a kind of story where you can’t stop yourself from cursing the protagonist, begging them to not do something stupid. But I think the personality of Julia created by the author is real, hence, unlikeable. She has recovered from addictions—first heroin, then alcohol. Now she is getting addicted to the case of her sister, to find the murderer, to a stranger from a hookup site. She knows the possible dangers of what she is doing, but she can’t stop herself. The ability to know the difference between right and wrong and still ending up in a mess is what makes her real, even if not likable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story develops pace in the last one-third part of the book. But it never felt boring. The author is able to make the reader immerse in Julia’s mind and her life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second Life makes you question who you trust. It makes you question who is right and who is wrong. I felt that too much was done for creating a mysterious plot. Although characters were written nicely, there was not a single character that I liked. There was a lack of a strong personality in the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has an open ending, which didn’t work out well for me. I was really hoping for a closure to the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall it was a great read. If you like to read a thriller which is not too fast and doesn’t have a lot of action, then you should definitely read this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jul 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/07/04/second-life-by-sj-watson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/07/04/second-life-by-sj-watson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Cure of Umba by Samuel Jukes</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early in the Third Age of Umbarra, a prophecy was told. Upon the great mountain spires of the magik races, the minds of Umba’s first beings conjured a great vision, and in it, they saw the future. Two fates of the world they lived upon, they saw its end and a new beginning. The evil that seeped from the blackness and the good that would come to keep them. The boy from the red sun must fall and the slaves of the fiery sea must climb to heal them all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon the streets of his township, life is rough for the homeless Redmond Daniels. The balance between right and wrong hangs delicately in a world of harsh reality. Pressured into gang life, Red’s choices lead him to crisis point, and he is forced to embark on a journey of self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His only fatherly influence, the elder, Mark Sinoda has a hidden past. The keeper of ancient knowledge, he has set foot on new worlds and the time had come to pass his great truth to the one he must. In search of a miracle cure for his closest friend, Red must entrust in Mark’s promises as he dreams of venturing beyond the broken streets of his African home to retrieve a great elixir to heal the woes of others.&lt;br /&gt; Forced far from his home, Red is cast into a new life upon a sacred temple, where he would come to learn of his forgotten ancestors and by sheer stubbornness and willing, he must overcome the challenges of the mind and tests from a new world. A world called Umba, where the lands he must travel too are brewing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The powers that be, readying for an assault upon the lands of the east, Red finds himself faced with the impossible task of traveling to Umba’s forgotten far north amid the chaos of war. To succeed, he must overcome and evolve as he steps forth to a new destiny. Unable to face his trials alone, Red finds an unlikely companion in a foreign being. Son of a great leader of the east, Errawak Esohh must unearth his own fate as he unravels the mystery of Red’s discovery and guides him towards the lands of his forefathers where the impossible cure of Umba awaits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I start to talk about Samuel Juke’s Fantasy fiction—The Cure of Umba, I would first of all like to appreciate the very intricately designed book cover. The book cover is one of the best I have ever seen. The cover itself keeps you engaged with a variety of characters depicted on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a quick chat with the author, he revealed, “I do them myself. I was an illustrator long before I started writing. This one took me a while, there was a lot of individual drawings that went into it. Guess it’s inspired by 90s Street fighter and anime covers.” Well, this cover definitely is worth all the efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking about the plot of the book, it is quite unique to whatever I have read till now in this genre. The book is initially set in Africa, where the reader is introduced to Redmond Daniels. Red then travels to mystical land of Umba to find a cure for his friend’s ailment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book offers a promising beginning. It introduces the readers to all the kingdoms of Umba and the kind of people (read: aliens) living there at the beginning. This introduction really excited me to know what this unique world had to offer, what these aliens with different kind of power had to offer, and what the book had to offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all the hype that author was able to create in the first few pages, the thing that acted as a turn off for me was the characters not being properly introduced. Sufficient details were not provided about their looks and personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that the characters are basically aliens with totally different looks than a normal human being (as can also be seen in the cover), it becomes important to describe them from their hair to their toe nail. I would have loved if the characters were presented as beautifully in the text as they were on the cover. Some characters though, were more graphically described than others. I really enjoyed the description of the dark world. It was more detailed than the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Writing style is a bit difficult to get into, hence, slows down the pace of reading. While reading the book, I couldn’t help myself but think about the TV Show—F.R.I.E.N.D.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember the scene where Joey is supposed to write a recommendation for Monica and Chandler? Joey meant to write “They’re warm, nice people with big hearts.” But instead, with the help of thesaurus he writes, “They’re humid, prepossessing homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps.” That is how a pretty large part of the book seems like. Take these for example: “His joy was apparent in his bulbous, and glazed eyes that twinkled as if encapsulating the ocean’s abyss.” “He wrenched his blade from the earth and twisted to strike his illusive opponent, only to gouge his arm in a slash of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t help but notice lack of editing in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My pace while reading the book was slow, but did I enjoy reading it? Yes. I loved the characters. I loved their conversations with each other. I loved how the emotions of greed, power, love, friendship, and patriotism are shown throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book ends with a nice message about miracles, religion, God, and higher power. I was definitely not expecting such a message. But it was a warm welcome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author’s love for animals is pretty visible throughout the novel. I don’t think any animal has not got a mention in the book. From an ant to a Bengal Tiger, the author hasn’t missed any. “His leading hand followed the floor like a snake as he pointed his palm down above his foot.” “His much swifter foe jumped high above him as he tucked one knee to his core and the other behind him like a leopard’s tail.” It was fun to see what animal is going to come up next and how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the plot and story of the book and would not mind reading more from the author.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jun 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/06/29/cure-of-umba-by-samuel-jukes/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/06/29/cure-of-umba-by-samuel-jukes/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Blood and Greed (Volume 1) by P.J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Award-winning fantasy author P.J. Berman steps into new territory by releasing four historical short stories of how the greed of the few costs the blood of the many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Bloody Day at Marathon After his home is destroyed and his family slaughtered, Theodosius thirsts for revenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Spirit of Poland Poland stands alone - and it’s fighting for its life. A handful of brave pilots embody the country’s defiance in the face of annihilation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Split Loyalties Its glory days may be over, but even in the tumult that engulfs the Western Roman Empire, Sigeric and Licinia are forced to wonder, does love really conquer all, or is that the preserve of the Roman legions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fate of Mari Carrying messages throughout the city of Mari is Bashaa’s life, but under the shadow of advancing enemies, his path is about to take a turn he could never have predicted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood and Greed is a collection of four historical short stories. The first third of the book consists of three short stories, while the remaining two-third is just one story. The title and the cover blend perfectly with the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each story is different from each other, in terms of setting, plot, and characters, but what is common between all the stories, is that there is an ongoing war - for freedom, or for greed. These stories remind us of the stupid human nature. A war may have one winner, but clearly both the parties are at loss because of all the bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked each of the stories. The fact that the author didn’t focus on making the protagonists win the wars really made the read enjoyable. Sadly, this book is not as well-edited as P.J. Berman’s all the other books are. But it didn’t deter me from enjoying the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the stories - The Spirit of Poland - ends up with “to be continued”. Well, a short story shouldn’t end on “to be continued”. Don’t you agree? But I really look forward to knowing what happens in Volume 2 of the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved how the author is able to create 4 different worlds in so few words. Having read his 2 full-length novels (of the Silrith Series) my concern before picking the book was - how can he write 4 stories in less than 90 pages. But I never felt any lack in the world-building. Each and every scene was just as detailed and visual as all of his other writings. The book takes you on the journey through 4 different eras and locations, from Erteria, Greece in 490 BCE, to 116th Fighter Escadrille, Poland in September 1939, to Gaul, Western Roman Empire, in early fifth century CE, and finally to The Kingdom of Mari, Mesopotamia in 1761 BCE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are wholesome. Even in the shortness of the stories, the author is able to present them in a way that make them likable and real. They are courageous and stand for what they feel is right. Their love for their nation is as strong as their love for family or crush. We see strong female characters - the best thing about any PJ Berman story - without being differentiated in the strengths and vigour of male characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are into historical fiction, or just want to try this genre, then this book is definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/23/blood-and-greed-by-pj-berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/23/blood-and-greed-by-pj-berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Girl, Stop Apologizing by Rachel Hollis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Girl, Stop Apologizing, #1 New York Times bestselling author and founder of a multimillion-dollar media company, Rachel Hollis sounds a wake-up call. She knows that many women have been taught to define themselves in light of other people—whether as wife, mother, daughter, or employee—instead of learning how to own who they are and what they want. With a challenge to women everywhere to stop talking themselves out of their dreams, Hollis identifies the excuses to let go of, the behaviors to adopt, and the skills to acquire on the path to growth, confidence, and believing in yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Girl, Stop Apologizing is a book that will keep you on your foot, since the time you read its title. It is right then, that you know, you are going to learn something and that it is gonna hit the chords of your heart. And it truly does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As much as it seems that it is a women-centered book, which would talk about the dos and don’ts for women. It is actually not. It just talks about how we, women, multitask - manage home and work. How we try to maintain a work-life balance but usually fail or deal with societal expectations, which women can relate to better than men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason that I liked this book is that the author definitely has a way with words. She is able to ignite you to work towards your dream - your one big goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book starts by pointing out excuses that people generally use to justify their inability to pursue their goals. Some of them being - “I am not a goal-oriented person”, “I don’t have time”, “I am not enough to succeed” and many more. I was able to relate to almost every excuse. I do use them often when I am not able to achieve my goals. The writer asks you to do away with these excuses if you really want to chase your dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the next part, the author talks about behaviours to adapt. She asks the readers to stop seeking approval or apologizing for your dreams. “There is a difference between having someone’s opinion vs. having someone’s approval.” It is your dream. You don’t have to be guilty of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in the last part, she talks about the skills one should acquire to be able to reach their goals. Now though it seems basic like planning, being effective, confident, and persistent, etc., she is able to break it up in a quite simple manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the overall flow of the book and the dedication of the writer to help people achieve their goals. But there were points where she unintentionally made some remarks which might not be appreciated by a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She constantly talked about getting in shape, dieting, appearance affecting confidence. I don’t say that these topics should not be discussed but a few of her statements were hurtful in nature. She talked about getting her boob job done because they grew from size B to E post having kids. She justified that by saying that she felt a lack of confidence because of her size. Well, she had the resources to do something so drastic to build up her confidence. Not everyone can. Does it mean that they can’t be confident, just because they don’t look like what they wish to look like?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the key takeaways for me were 1) Make a weekly schedule of what you do. See where you are wasting time. Try to make out time for your dreams. 2) Do not hold on to your past when the mean people said mean things. You are capable. Trust yourself. YOU ARE ENOUGH. 3) It is okay to have a work-life imbalance 4) The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. So focus on the present and work towards your goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, if you have a dream in your life, then disregard of your gender this book will just help you achieve it. Additional benefits will be that women will know that nothing should stop them. They should not be ashamed of their goals, however selfish they may sound and men will realize that what women mean when they say that it is easier for guys - Guys are not supposed to be the stay at home parents as per societal conventions, their goal to make lots of money is not considered selfish or self-obsessed. They’ll be able to understand women better after reading this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many things that we start accepting as second nature because that has been ingrained into us since birth, by what we see and observe around us. But it is time to drop those so-called societal conventions and focus on YOU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this book, but if you think “body size and beauty” is a trigger topic for you, then I would suggest you avoid it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/21/girl-stop-apologizing-by-rachel-hollis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/21/girl-stop-apologizing-by-rachel-hollis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Love Unecpected by Ritu Kakar</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaira is an independent girl, chasing her ambitions. Aveer is a strong-minded and successful entrepreneur, seeking expansion. When they get together to give wings to her venture, there are fireworks and a strange chemistry between them. But there is something else walking along – Kaira’s past. With Drew’s presence looming large like the devil, Kaira does not know how to accept her emotions for Aveer. Her loved ones protect her from all harm fiercely, but will they succeed this time too? Amidst confusion of a promising future and the demons of the past, in trying to find faith and burying betrayal, and in the battle between Kaira’s heart and her fears will lead the way to happiness?.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love Unexpected revolves around the life of the protagonist, Kaira. Having a bad relationship in the past, she is now trying to focus solely on her Café Library. She is pretty sure that “love” is not for her until she bumps into a mystery man and all those tingling sensations start coming to her. I loved the simplicity of the writing style. The title and the blurb don’t leave much to wonder. But the moments in the story are cute, and keeps you hooked. It is our usual romantic comedy. A career-oriented female lead with a dark past, an overly - almost unrealistically - handsome male lead with no defects, bump into each other out of nowhere, and fall in love.  Along with the love story of Kaira, it is also the story of friendship between Kaira and Tasha, and their journey through the thick and thin. Kaira and Sam depict a great brother-sister relationship and their banters are fun to read. As interesting the plot and the writing was, I believe that the characters do lack some depth. Aveer is introduced in the story but his past is nowhere under discussion. At one point we see Kaira searching through the magazines and internet about this top publisher, but she finds no personal life details of this guy. I think this was preferred by the writer to get away from going into details of the character. But, that would have certainly made the character more lovable. Similarly, Drew was simply a douchebag character. Some efforts could have been made into making his character reasonable.  Nevertheless, it was a fun read. Recommended if you are looking for afun, quick, and light-hearted read. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/18/love-unexpected-by-ritu-kakar/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/18/love-unexpected-by-ritu-kakar/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar by Kochery Shibu</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A hydelpower project in the remote Himalayas. Three people brought together by fate. Nanda, an engineer from Kerala at the dam construction site hiding from his past, from the law, torn between the love of his dear ones and the traditional kalari code of revenge. Khusru, a boy displaced from his native village in Kashmir, a gambit in the terror plot threatening to blow up the dam, working as a labourer at the site. Rekha, a Kathak dancer in heart, a doctor by profession, arrives at the campsite as the consort of Khusru. A village that accepts the dictates of modernity with a heavy heart, its population steeped in superstitions and religious beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All throng the campsite like moths to a flame, some escape untouched, successful; some, miss a step, and perish. Each has a story to tell and a dream to realise. Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar is about the aspirations of these people with their cares and worries woven into the site life. The fury of nature and the hardships of project life have no mercy for the weak and no time for the dead. Like an eternal spectator the Dhauladhar watches as men risk life and limb in a quest to fulfill their dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men and Dreams in the Dhauladhar is a combination of thriller and technical fictionI really like the theme of the story. The story of each character is different and remarkable in its own way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many characters, and each has been given space to familiarize the readers with their stories. Sadly, that didn’t work out for me. The focus is shifted from the main characters - Nanda, Khusru, and Rekha and divided into all the others who don’t have a major role to play in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Till the time I had read 90% of the book (literally, because I kept track on my kindle) the following was happening - new characters being introduced with each chapter and no character development taking place. The characters are totally unaffected by anything happening around them. They are scared of only one thing which has affected their lives and remain to be so throughout. None of the characters is able to leave a lasting impact on the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has been able to create a very vivid picture of life at a Dam Construction site. Tension, fun, fight for pay, poor working conditions, and the technicality of the project, are all discussed with utmost sincerity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a story is created by the characters and their actions and reactions to everything happening around them. While creating a brilliant background story for each character, the author somewhere failed to connect them well. They stood out as individuals not supporting characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was rushed in the last 10% of the book. Well, not only rushed it also did not justify the story. Something which has been the center of the story in the entire book was naively done away with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use of other language is interesting, but in this book, there were way too many references of Hindi, Kannada, and Frech words and phrases which didn’t work really well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some parts of the book which continued in a single paragraph through more than one page. These kinds of lengthy paragraphs suck the energy out of a reader and make it less fun and more strenuous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea behind the story was unique but could have been executed in a better way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 May 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/16/men-and-dreams-in-the-dhauladhar-by-kochery-shibu/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/05/16/men-and-dreams-in-the-dhauladhar-by-kochery-shibu/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Awakening by Grant Langley</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some secrets are better left untold Jabuti will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about his childhood. Suffering personal tragedies that would defeat a lesser man, he seeks advice from the wise old shaman. What he hears on that fateful morning propels him on a hazardous expedition deep into the heart of the rainforest. With blood-curdling tales of savage cannibals and crooked white men who seek to exploit the innocent, he departs with trepidation. Joined by his two close friends they embark upon an epic quest that imperils them at every turn. In this charged atmosphere two different civilisations will clash most brutally with cataclysmic consequences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jabuti had a very disturbing life. His father left him, and his mother died while giving birth to him. He blames himself for all of that. But later he realizes that whatever he had known had all been a lie. He decides to go on a quest to find out the truth himself. Jabuti is an extremely emotional person. He is very unstable. He is easily depressed whenever he talks about his parents. The constant breakdowns on the mere mention of his parents, honestly, was kind of irritating. His friends Wanadi and Mapi, who joined him on his quest, didn’t play a major role. They were just add-ons in the journey. Although they did save each other in times of danger, they were not very much emotionally supportive of each other. They didn’t seem like friends since childhood. I didn’t see the kind of comfort level amongst them as you see in best friends. Newer friends were more emotionally attached than these three. The plot of the story was interesting, and the twists kept me hooked. But lack of emotions was a turn-off. I would have loved if there were some real emotions, not just Jabuti crying over something he had no control over. A little more background about Wanadi and Mapi, and a part of the story from their point of view would have been great. Being a part of Jabuti’s Quest Trilogy, cliffhangers were expected, keeping you looking forward to what is next to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/23/the-awakening-by-grant-langley/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/23/the-awakening-by-grant-langley/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Milk and Honey by Rupi Kaur</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milk and honey’ is a collection of poetry and prose about survival. About the experience of violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. It is split into four chapters, and each chapter serves a different purpose. Deals with a different pain. Heals a different heartache. ‘milk and honey’ takes readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Milk &amp;amp; Honey is a collection of poetries and proses by Rupi Kaur. The central themes are violence, abuse, love, loss, and femininity. The book is divided into 4 parts - The Hurting, The Loving, The Breaking, and The Healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The content is excellent. It touches your heart, and you are instantly able to empathize with the narrator. It is sad but teaches you an important lesson about healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blurb states, “ ‘milk and honey’ take readers through a journey of the most bitter moments in life and finds sweetness in them because there is sweetness everywhere if you are just willing to look”. I don’t agree with that. The book is like a journal of an abused girl. She shares her deepest secrets and whatever she has gone through. Starting from the abusive father, and being molested and raped by her cousin and uncle. She then talks about moving on, with that pain hidden in some corner of her heart. She falls in love with a guy, who ends up cheating on her. She tries to tell the guy that the new girl would never keep him as happy and satisfied as she could. Gradually, she realizes that all this begging is not worth it and that she needs to learn to love herself first. And hence, she takes her steps towards healing. You can’t find anything sweet in such situations. But you can work on your healing. You can try to forget the past and find things that make you happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What made the reading experience a little rough for me was the non-capitalization of words and inconsistent use of “you”. Sometimes it was used for the guy she loved, and sometimes for the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first half of the book, the thoughts were presented a bit haphazardly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is no doubt an emotional ride and pushes you to work on healing yourself. But if you are very critical of grammar, flow, and structure of a book, then this one is not the best selection for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/12/milk-and-honey-by-rupi-kaur/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/12/milk-and-honey-by-rupi-kaur/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Life's Amazing Secrets by Gaur Gopal Das</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;While navigating their way through Mumbai’s horrendous traffic, Gaur Gopal Das and his wealthy young friend Harry get talking, delving into concepts ranging from the human condition to finding one’s purpose in life and the key to lasting happiness. Whether you are looking at strengthening your relationships, discovering your true potential, understanding how to do well at work or even how you can give back to the world, Gaur Gopal Das takes us on an unforgettable journey with his precious insights on these areas of life. Das is one of the most popular and sought-after monks and life coaches in the world, having shared his wisdom with millions. His debut book, Life’s Amazing Secrets, distils his experiences and lessons about life into a light-hearted, thought-provoking book that will help you align yourself with the life you want to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life’s amazing secrets are a self-help book in the form of fiction. The writing style is simple. If you are not into self-help books or reading, then this book is a good start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gaur Gopal Das meets his wealthy friend, Harry over lunch. They start to talk about Harry’s successful and happy life. But everything is not as good as it seems. The narrator understands the situation and starts talking about 4 wheels of life - Personal Life, Relationships, Work-Life, and Social Contribution: and how it is important to focus on each one of them for a perfect life. The narrator takes examples from his life to explain each aspect of life to Harry. Step by step, he takes the reader through all the 4 wheels of life. Each of the 4 parts is further divided into segments to be worked upon to improve in that area. The division is not a very rigid one. Improving one segment could help you improve in more than one area. A few chapters that I personally loved are Growing through Gratitude, Correcting Cautiously, and Decoding Spirituality at Work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrator also talks about Ikigai in the end - why should we have an Ikigai and how can we find ours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Apr 2020</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/10/lifes-amazing-secrets-by-gaur-gopal-das/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2020/04/10/lifes-amazing-secrets-by-gaur-gopal-das/</guid> </item> <item> <title>King of the Republic by P. J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;King of the Republic is the second novel in P.J.Berman’s explosive Silrith series, a new power in the world of epic fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Queen Silrith has fallen. Now she must rise again. However, when her army lands in Etrovansia in search of reinforcements and political support, their welcome is far from warm. Their retreat from one war could start another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina, a vengeful Hentani priestess, feels the weight of expectation placed on her by her tribe. Without Jezna by her side, her headship is a lonely one. Will the arrival of strange new allies prove a welcome help or complicate matters further?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun, an ambitious young politician, rides a wave of public support amid the passion of revolution. Now he must restore order before the mob descends into anarchy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three rebels stand on the precipice of their defining moments. There is no going back now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the tyrannical usurper, King Jostan, brings new violence to the Verusantian reign of terror over Bennvika.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;King of the Republic is the second book in the Silrith Series. Action, drama, suspense and a lot of battles. It has everything. A rightful queen’s fight for her kingdom, a politician fighting for democracy, and a young girl fighting to avenge the oppression of her tribe. Different motives but a common enemy. King Jostan - a tyrannical king who wants to rule the world and spread his religion among the masses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What started simply as a fight between right and wrong in book 1 has turned more complex with the boundaries of truths and lies now turning blur. As we move further in the plot we can see some serious politics and superficial alliances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the character development in this book. The characters come up with stronger personalities. A lot of new characters were introduced in this book, and the author was able to pull it off really well. Each character had its own space, personality, and role to play in the story. A lot of strong-headed women in a story is something which is not very common in books. The author just brings us that - Women with “I want it, I’ll get it” attitude.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style of PJ Berman is very detailed. He makes sure that the reader gets the full picture of the scene. From the lack of resources and people to the emotions expressed not in words, but through action, the reader is not just a viewer but a part of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Needless to say, the book is full of unexpected twists and turns and ends on a cliffhanger, leaving you waiting for the release of part 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, I really recommend the series even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You should definitely check out the audiobook by Chris Dukes @chrisdukes93&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>30 Dec 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/12/30/king-of-the-republic-by-pj-berman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/12/30/king-of-the-republic-by-pj-berman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Animal Farm by George Orwell</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A farm is taken over by its overworked, mistreated animals. With flaming idealism and stirring slogans, they set out to create a paradise of progress, justice, and equality. Thus the stage is set for one of the most telling satiric fables ever penned –a razor-edged fairy tale for grown-ups that records the evolution from revolution against tyranny to a totalitarianism just as terrible. When Animal Farm was first published, Stalinist Russia was seen as its target. Today it is devastatingly clear that wherever and whenever freedom is attacked, under whatever banner, the cutting clarity and savage comedy of George Orwell’s masterpiece have a meaning and message still ferociously fresh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Animal farm is a political satire written by George Orwell. As the novel begins, we can see all the animals frustrated of their owner, Mr. Jones. They believe that they are being overutilized and not even given enough food to survive. The last straw is blown when Mr. Jones forget to feed the animals one day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The pigs decide to start a revolt against the humans and convince all the other animals to join them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially what started as a group effort, later turned into a fight for power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pigs being the only animals to be able to read became the leaders of the rebellion. Initially everything was shared equally amongst all the animals and the rules decided for the group were inclusive of everyone. But gradually the greed for power took over the philosophy of united animals. The rules were changed as per the convenience of the pigs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a mockery of the political leaders who first try to influence the public by giving them incentives and later taking it all away without the public even realising what they are losing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book was written in 1945 and 2020 is just round the corner. 75 years of this masterpiece and it still doesn’t fail to mesmerize us by throwing at us the brutal reality of politics and power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George Orwell as always has succeeded in setting up an environment which is realistic and believable (ofcourse not with animals though).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dialogues are powerful and character development is great. The greed for power of some animals, the ignorant attitude of some, while some being the puppets of the powerful is just the public everywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I tried an audiobook for the first time. I just searched for an audiobook on YouTube and found one narrated by Hosam Hamed. The narrator has not just narrated the story but performed it with his expressions, voice modulation and mimicry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall the book is amazing and I believe it is even more fun if narrated by someone. I felt like a kid again, listening to a bedtime story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this book!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Nov 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/11/23/Animal-Farm-by-George-Orwell/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/11/23/Animal-Farm-by-George-Orwell/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Book Thief by Markus Zusak</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will be busier still.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By her brother’s graveside, Liesel’s life is changed when she picks up a single object, partially hidden in the snow. It is The Gravedigger’s Handbook, left behind there by accident, and it is her first act of book thievery. So begins a love affair with books and words, as Liesel, with the help of her accordian-playing foster father, learns to read. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor’s wife’s library, wherever there are books to be found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these are dangerous times. When Liesel’s foster family hides a Jew in their basement, Liesel’s world is both opened up, and closed down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Book Thief is a heart touching story of Nazi Germany written with German perspective and narrated by death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no suspense, no twist, no “damn! I didn’t see that coming” because the death here doesn’t kill you in one swift go but it slowly tortures you. It tells you that when and how the characters die and then take you on a ride to see and feel it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It gives you an insight of the war times. The condition of not the politicians or the army or even the Jews but the condition of poor Germans. Lack of food, declining jobs, constant fear of bombings taking place and what happens if there is a Jew hidden in the basement of one of the German houses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first half we hardly see Hitler or his army. But the tension and the slowly growing chaos is still visible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Character development is great. They are strong and they are vulnerable. They are broken yet together. They make you smile and then make you cry bitterly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea and the execution of the story is brilliant. This book is definitely a book which should be added to your “must read” list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Sep 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/29/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/29/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Vengeance of Hope by P.J. Berman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vengeance of Hope, P.J.Berman’s explosive debut novel, marks the beginning of the Silrith series; a new power in the world of epic fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This opening book pitches you head first into the intense and unrelentingly dangerous Kingdom of Bennvika, a world of strong, powerful women and ambitious, ruthless men. As a bitter power struggle surges through the land, you are just as likely to die in a devious political plot as you are in the carnage of a great, bloody battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your ears will ring with the clang of steel on steel. Your heart will tremble at the thundering of charging hooves. You will feel the cut and slash of blades as you follow three very different rebels in their desperate fight against a tyrannical King.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silrith, the exiled Princess of Bennvika, stands shoulder to shoulder with her followers, sword in hand, ready to defend those in need of her protection. Yet she knows that if she falls, thousands more will also perish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ezrina, of the Hentani tribe, burns with desire for revenge against those who oppress her people, but more than anything she must fight to protect the woman she could be executed for loving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zethun, an ambitious young politician, yearns for a fairer world with a greater voice for the poor. However, for him and his followers, to speak the word ‘republic’, could be a fatally dangerous move in a land ruled by a despot. Will the rebel factions succeed? Or in the indiscriminate butchery of war, will their disunity prove to be their downfall, bringing about the destruction of their world as they know it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With vivid imagery, a punchy writing voice, detailed worldbuilding and an unapologetically fast pace, Vengeance of Hope has everything an epic fantasy novel needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A queen turned warrior, a rebel protecting her tribe and an ambitious politician. All of them fight individually against one, the self proclaimed King of the Empire of Bennvika.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your ears will ring with the clang of steel on steel. Your heart will tremble at the thundering of charging hooves. You will feel the cut and slash of blades as you follow three very different rebels in their desperate fight against a tyrannical King.” (Extract from blurb)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was my first try at reading a fantasy (except Mahabharata and Ramayana. I studied those in my school and even gave exam as those were a part of curriculum). So this first try was definitely worth it. I really enjoyed the story, the characters and the plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason for a war is generally one amongst these (a) to acquire more land and hence wealth and power (b) to spread your culture/religion (c) revenge. But this book has it all. A greedy king who wants power to rule and also force his religious beliefs on the citizens. And a rightful Queen, who has been wrongly thrown away from the throne, who wants to avenge her father’s death and take up the throne for the well being of her Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development was amazing. Each character had a strong role and visibility. Powerful women, greedy men, ambitious politicians, and clueless masses. Everyone has their roles and those are written really well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even with so much of fictional characters, locations, and terms, the author has tried to create a realistic world which is not at all boring and keeps you hooked to know ‘what next?’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t wait for the second part in the series - King of the Republic which is due to be released in December, 2019&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You must checkout the audio book of Vengeance Of Hope which is to be released in July, 2019.

It is a story of mutual feeling of how we love each other, but we are shy to show it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is quite real. Today’s young generation have their goals and ambitions. People tend to believe that our goals are more important to us than our family. But it is not true. We just have different goals, different vision than our parents had years ago. That doesn’t mean that our love and respect for our elders is any less. We want to reach the sky but we also know the importance of keeping our feet on the ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I feel our generation is very much misunderstood. Our spontaneity does not mean that we are rude, it just means that we are aware. Our plans to go abroad for studies or just to live away from our family, doesn’t mean that we don’t love them; it just means that we want to be independent. We don’t want to bother our parents for every little thing. Our idea of settling down is not to get married and have kids. It is to earn enough to give ourselves and our family a much better and comfortable life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the way Debjeet Mukherjee has been able to present this basic emotion in the simplest way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Sep 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/09/the-farewell-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/09/09/the-farewell-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Paper Towns by John Green</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;Blurb:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quentin Jacobsen has spent a lifetime loving the magnificently adventurous Margo Roth Spiegelman from afar. So when she cracks open a window and climbs into his life—dressed like a ninja and summoning him for an ingenious campaign of revenge—he follows. After their all-nighter ends, and a new day breaks, Q arrives at school to discover that Margo, always an enigma, has now become a mystery. But Q soon learns that there are clues—and they’re for him. Urged down a disconnected path, the closer he gets, the less Q sees the girl he thought he knew…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;My Review:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quentin Jacobsen is a usual teenage character having usual problems, and bunch of friends who are crazy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there is Margo Roth Spiegelman, an adventurous girl. The one Q has a crush on since their childhood. The one who has now turned into a mystery, which Q has to unravel The book is filled with drama, suspense, and humour. John Green as always never ceases to surprise his readers with his wit and philosophy of life. Margo leaves a number of clues, intentionally as well as unintentionally for Q to find her. Gradually as Q join the dots, and as closer he gets to find her, the more he realises that this is not the Margo he once knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Margo leaves the clues from Woody Guthrie’s album to Walt Whitman’s Song of Myself. The clues are all over but not enough for a normal person to narrow it down to one particular place, where Margo could be found. But with his luck and his friends’ support, Q is going to find more than he thought he would. I won’t say that this book is something inspirational or motivational, since Margo runs away from her home, leaving behind her family and friends. But it definitely is a story about friendship. Margo thought that all of her friends ditched her, but the truth is there were people who genuinely cared about her. We always expect the people not to be themselves. We want them to behave the way we are comfortable with. And that is what the other person also thinks. This creates clashes and we think the other person don’t like us. Instead it is just what they are. You can’t change what you are. Similarly others can’t change what they are. And learning this basic thing could solve a hell lot of problems in our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you John Green for teaching your readers the basic life lessons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t even need to say this, but this book is definitely recommended.&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Aug 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/21/paper-towns-by-john-green/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/21/paper-towns-by-john-green/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Hot Love Inferno by Nicky Blue</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A half-woman, half-cockroach fused in a bizarre gardening accident? That would be Mrs Jittery Twitch, dwelling in the shadows of our misdeeds. If in danger, you can call upon her help… all she asks is your soul as payment. But she’s just a legend, so no need to worry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barry Harris is a 28-year-old man, still living with his dear old mum in a little flat above a hairdresser. His obsession with Star Trek and the martial arts won’t help him when he’s forced out on a date. And nobody knows about the weird string of events that’s about to put everyone’s lives in danger. A trio of samurai warriors and the strangest offer of help lead Barry on a perilous mission to save the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(This book is the second in the Prophecy Allocation series but works fine as a standalone read.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why you should read this book:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It explains revolutionary insights into the nature of reality that debunk the myth of free will (probably).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It proves the multiverse has only two parallel universes (depending on your criteria for what makes up proof).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It contains 50% extra innuendo-based gags than Book One in the series. Some of them might be considered funny (again this is relative).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The author achieved a heightened dynamic tension not found in other books. He was heavily constipated during its creation. There may be a link. The author is no way suggesting that this makes it better than every other book ever written.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The book is written in British English. All British slang terms are helpfully translated for the international reader, along with a short explanation of why British people are a little strange.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hot Love Inferno is the second book in Prophecy Allocation series. Though it can also be read as a standalone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a really interesting combination of science fiction, action, and dark comedy. It is full of quirky one liners which makes the read entertaining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I started the book, it was difficult to identify the characters, maybe because I haven’t read the part 1. But gradually I was able to connect to the characters and the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best part of the book is footnotes provided by author. It is funny and works as a bonus material at the end of each chapter. It is a fast paced story. Scenes take place one after other making some scenes a bit unclear. Some scenes and characters like Bertie Backwards and the Oracle seem out of place and are not really required in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this book if you like dark humour with a touch of science fiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Aug 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/18/hot-love-inferno-by-nicky-blue/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/08/18/hot-love-inferno-by-nicky-blue/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Ascent of Love by Rooprashi</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Taara met Vedant, she fell in love for the first time. However, she could not perceive that a feeling as pure as love can turn into something so toxic for her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As she decided to leave her love behind and climb peaks of the world, she knew that the love for the peaks was not hers either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As she questions herself and is inept to understand why she is not able to forget her past, her ascent to the peaks was making the difference apparent to her. Something she already knew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Had she found a new love, or was love back in an old package to spite her again? Does a difficult mountaineering course in Kashmir prove to be the turning point in her life? Will she be able to complete her ‘Ascent of Love’ the way she intended to, or will a hailstorm change the plan of her life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ascent of Love is the love story of Vedanth and Taara through the point of view of Taara, mostly set across the beauty of mountains and having a cameo of a storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is cliché romance which is nicely written. It takes you on a trip to Kashmir without you having to move an inch. The description of places and the beauty wants you to pack your bags and leave for Kashmir immediately. You can feel the serenity and the winds. (Lol no! That last part was a bit of exaggeration. You can’t feel the serenity and winds when the temperature around is nearly 50°C)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story transitions between past and present to simultaneously present the story of Taara and Vedanth over the leap of 5 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was an enjoyable and fast read. You can’t expect any twists and turns with this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover and the title are fitting for the storyline. The cover especially seems to come straight out of a movie poster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended for a light, cliché, not at all explicit romance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/29/the-ascent-of-love-by-rooprashi/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/29/the-ascent-of-love-by-rooprashi/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Big Switch by John Thomas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What does a 24-year-old man want in life? Love? A decent job? Keith has both. He is a software engineer at a reputable company and has a girlfriend whom he loves a lot. Yet, there is something missing in his life. He is not even close to being happy. Only after losing his girlfriend, he realizes what the reason for his unhappiness is. He realizes that he is caught up in the wrong career. With time running out, he knows that he must switch to a new career — one that makes him happy. But, is 24 too late to do that? Is he making a mistake? Find out as Keith follows his heart in pursuit of an impossible-looking dream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Big Switch is a story is about pursuing your dreams. It reminds us that it is never too late to follow your heart. The story revolves around Keith, his life and his decision to pursue his dreams. Everyone else were merely supporting characters in his journey towards his goal. The author could have diverted from the main plot and went on explaining all the aspects of the story of other characters as well, but he was able to keep the focus of the story intact. Midway through the book, I thought that the decisions made by Keith were stupid and unrealistic, but it all started making sense over the course of story. Author was truly the god of the characters, writing their fates. Now, you do not question God’s ways. Do you? I love the character of Rahul. He is an amazing manager, a great leader, true friend and a determined supporter. Writing style is great and easily relatable. Characterization is done well. There are no ‘villians’ in the story. Who needs a villian in their life, when their lives already suck! The doubts in Keith’s mind are very real. Questioning your desires and your abilities is something very natural. He is confused, he is scared, but he is determined to make his dream come true. If you are currently working you might get some great tips in the book (not only how to switch your profession, but also how to stick to the job while being able to maintain a work – life balance) If you are a manager/leader you will know what TO BE and what NOT to be. This book makes you realise the importance of having good friends, a role model, and a dream. If you start working for thing you like to do, you’ll gradually find a way to reach a place where you are supposed to reach. Very much recommended if you are feeling stuck somewhere in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/the-big-switch-by-john-thomas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/the-big-switch-by-john-thomas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>WYRD - The Wild &amp; Weird Adventures of A + B (Part 1 - Japan) by Shasha Borya</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wyrd: The Wild and Weird Adventures of A + B is a travelogue of two people Aleks and Boris in different parts of the world. This particular book is a description of their travel to Japan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks in length about Japan, the culture, various locations, the people and the food around there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I just loved the vibes of the book. It is cool, adventurous, spontaneous and humorous. Like any unplanned travel to an unknown place, with language barriers, this book is also full of realisation about cultural differences and flawed Google translations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever been in such a situation, you will know how relatable the book is. And moreover if you are vegetarian/vegan at a place dominated by non vegetarians, then you can’t stop sympathizing with the characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is fun to read. The descriptions are so detailed that it actually takes the reader on a tour of Japan. Not having visited Japan myself, it has intrigued me to go there atleast once in my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you love to travel, and you want to go to Japan this book will tell you honest do’s and don’ts. And even if you don’t want to go to Japan then this book would give you a trip in the comfort of your bed (though you can’t resist the idea of going to Japan after reading it.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/WYRD-part-1-Japan-by-Shasha-Borya/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/27/WYRD-part-1-Japan-by-Shasha-Borya/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Joshua’s 7 Gifts by Trishala Ahalpara</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is Alicia Grey and I have a story to tell. It all started the last Summer when I decided to visit my grandpa in the small town of Brakonhall. There I met a guy named Joshua Summerfied. For me, he was the average guy from the village nothing so interesting about him. But this guy had a secret and a task in hand. For me the task was simple, to gift his anonymous friend Joanna Willow something which he never had. But what was that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;the-review-contains-spoiler&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is based on the theme of colors. It speaks of the importance of colors. We normally take such things (as the ability to see) for granted. This story makes us sympathize with those who can’t see clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story started like a “Dora The Explorer” expedition to find something. Here it was 7 gifts of the 7 colors of a rainbow. I would have loved it more had it shown the description of Joshua’s understanding of colors in a better and a little more detailed way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The focus was immediately shifted from colorful gifts to Joshua which decreased the value of gifts in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, the grammar was bad at some place making it a fluency breaker in the reading process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story though predictable was a nice read. I would recommend the book if you are looking for a short and fresh read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>13 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/13/joshuas-7-gifts-by-trishala-ahalpara/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/13/joshuas-7-gifts-by-trishala-ahalpara/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Mehboob Murderer by Nupur Anand</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a rainy September night, six people are gunned down mercilessly in an old Parsi cafe in Mumbai. The mass murder at Cafe Mehboob, located barely a few hundred meters from the police station, and right next to one of the busiest railway stations in Mumbai, jolts the city out of its complacence. The media immediately swings into action, while political pressure mounts on the police force to nab the murderer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With everyone eager to place the blame of the murders on a madman in a bid to have the case dismissed swiftly, the headstrong inspector Intekhaab Abbas is determined to get to the bottom of the murders. On probing the lives of the victims, he stumbles upon a heady cocktail of love, lust, jealousy, betrayal, rage, longing, misery and ecstasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mehboob Murderer, Nupur Anand’s debut novel, unravels a stunning truth neither the police nor the reader is prepared for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mehboob Murderer is based on an interesting plot of a mass murder of 6 people in Café Mehboob. It is difficult to nab the criminal as there is no clue or evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;6 victims and 5 suspects. All having a reason to commit the murder. Through the journey of solving the case, the reader gets a glimpse of the back story of all the victims and the potential murderers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The build up of the story is nicely done but it was predictable. I was able to point out the murderer in the first half of the story, though what kept me hooked was the reason of the murder and an interest in knowing the story of all the potential murderers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend this novel if you want to have a light mystery, where not a lot of efforts is required in understanding what is happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jul 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/04/mehboob-murderer-by-nupur-anand/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/07/04/mehboob-murderer-by-nupur-anand/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Metamorphosis by Ivy Logan</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amelia, Peradora’s teenage heiress is a fashionista and boasts of 6 million followers on Twitter. In reality she is a bit of an introvert, a prisoner in a golden cage and her ‘it girl’ image is nothing but a carefully crafted, elaborate P.R. plan, masterminded by her guardian, Liam, the dictator of Peradora.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As secrets from her past dodge her at every turn, can Amelia choose between Adrian, the adventure junkie, her first love and Noah, the handsome bodyguard, and her best friend? Do they have secrets of their own, they’re keeping from her?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Peradora, her beloved nation is in trouble, and a sorceress ancestor, grants Amelia the ability to shape shift. Will it prove to be a curse or a boon? Will the power be too much for Amelia to handle? And can it truly change who she is inside, a frightened girl, quite out of her depth?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a stunning set of events unfold, will the truth set Amelia free or will she learn that some secrets are best buried in the past?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amelia, Peradora’s teenage heiress, is being used by Liam, her uncle to keep up his diamond business. Amelia gradually comes afront with the secrets that have been kept hidden from her for years. And with the secrets come a great responsibility of saving her nation, Peradora and a gift of shape shifting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is part 2 of Breach Chronicles, but can be read as a stand alone. Though you need to read the upcoming part to know what happens next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has a nice element of Urban Fantasy. I liked the characters. The role of woman in fighting for themselves as well as their loved ones is what I loved in this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cover is not representative of the story, but works nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the author repeating same stuff over and over in the book while skipping main parts like how exactly did a fight took place etc. This kind of made me lose my interest in the otherwise good plot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Jun 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/06/07/metamorphosis-by-ivy-logan/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/06/07/metamorphosis-by-ivy-logan/</guid> </item> <item> <title>When Stars Align by E.K. McCoy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you believe in destiny—a predetermined, irresistible course of events that no act of human intervention can deter? Dr. Augustus Owens, an ER trauma specialist, does. He believes an invisible force is always present with him and is the deciding factor between life or death. Dr. Owens realizes that in life we can only do so much before something else takes control and decides fate for us.But what role does destiny play in love? How much control do we really have in matters of the heart?As is true with most young medical residents, confident and determined Dr. Owens cannot afford to waste time on girls or parties. He works long and hard and is dedicated to advancing his career at any cost. So why is he feeling so undeniably drawn to the mysterious girl he spotted at a frat party next door? Almost as if under a spell, a sudden vulnerability consumes him, and he feels the need to be as close to her as he possibly can be.On the pages of this book fate and time weave a riveting, heartwarming tale of why Dr. Owens was forced in her direction from the minute he laid eyes on her. Their paths were destined to cross, and there was no stopping destiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Stars Align is a love story of a guy who is a Doctor and a girl who is pursuing Music as a major in her college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It talks about the struggles of being a doctor. How a doctor finds it difficult to be available for their family because of their priority being to save lives of other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elsie is an under-confident girl who does not recognises her singing talent when everyone around her does. She is shy, introvert and overconcious. Auggie is a doctor whose only priority is his work which seems to change when he meets Elsie. He is hot, smart and humourous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a story of love influenced by time and destiny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of romance, but books like these take a special in my heart because of their writing style. The dialogues are so powerful and the characters so meaningful that you can’t not cry or feel their plight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My favourite character is Marie, for always being there for her best friend, Elsie. She didn’t just only say that she was like her sister, she proved it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are ups and downs in this book as every romance has but I loved the way the suspense was maintained throughout the book. Why and how things happened, were revealed slowly, keeping the reader hooked to the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book if you are looking for something different than a cheesy romance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/29/when-stars-align-by-ek-mccoy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/29/when-stars-align-by-ek-mccoy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Unobliterated by Samridhhi Manadawat</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered the emotions of:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;a girl who is in love for the first time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a girl who gets her periods for the first time&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;successful woman who undergoes an emotional stress&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;women who breastfeed&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;emotions running through a rape survivor&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a widow who masturbates out of her unusual sexual desires&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;desires and hopes of a prostitute from the society and such allied topics?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unobiliterated is a collection of poetries, which talk about women and topics revolving around women. These topics are the variety of emotions and situations faced by women around the world. The writer boldly and openly talks about stuff such as sexuality, motherhood, rape and prostitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple yet touching. The author successfully takes the reader to the dark side of life of a woman, which is more than often is left untalked and undiscussed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a short read and definitely recommended if you want to explore more about the life of a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/24/unobliterated-by-samridhhi-mandawat/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/24/unobliterated-by-samridhhi-mandawat/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Falling for Fallon by S.J. Sylvis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Somehow, at the ripe age of twenty-three, I find myself in line to marry a man I don’t love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grind my teeth right there at the dinner table as my mother and father go on and on about how proud they are of me, how proud they are that I, Fallon Addington, will no longer be the black sheep of the family and become the daughter they’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marry Derek and they’ll finally accept me. Marry Derek and they’ll stop shoving men from their “social circle” in my direction. Marry Derek and become the spitting image of my mother; the perfect corporate wife with a face full of make-up and not a hair out of line. Marry Derek and all the shame and guilt will disappear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then… I embarrassingly flash Emmett Lanning my bra and suddenly my parents’ hopes and dreams are burning up in flames, right there along with my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the second novel in the Oak Hill Series, but can be read as a standalone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about Fallon, a girl from super rich family, who falls in love with a guy from Oak Hill, Emmett, who is the brother of Dawson (protagonist from book 1 of the series). Hence new characters are introduced in the second installment of the series while keeping the characters from 1st book intact. But this doesn’t require the reader to go through the 1st book before reading the 2nd one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story was predictable, the writing style was brilliant. I really enjoyed reading the story. The emotions that came with the book were raw and real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed how the honestly the dillemas of Fallon were shown throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book takes the reader on a journey of a forced arranged marriage, family drama, friend turned lover, all whilst trying to learn to choose oneself before others. Making yourself the priority is not selfish, it is healing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book was a fun read. Though slow initially the author was able to keep the reader hooked with quirky characters and captivating dialogues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for a light romantic comedy or a rich girl and not so rich guy kind of story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/23/falling-for-fallon-by-sj-sylvis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/23/falling-for-fallon-by-sj-sylvis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Snapped Threads by Riddhi Agarwal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;She turned the key of her car and it sputtered to life. She jammed the accelerator as the engine roared. With all her might, she pulled the gears and the world behind them blurred away. As they pushed past the house, she heard a deafening scream from a familiar voice. “Enigma!” The lady cried as the people in the market turned in hopes of gathering new gossip. Marinated in a world of competition, Snapped Threads is a portrayal of a struggle for justice. The story weaves together diverse lives against the backdrop of an art theft. Renewing the essence of love, friendship, betrayal, ambition and greed, the story is a reflection of an encounter made at the crossroads of deception and loyalty. The characters embark on new journeys-some with the desires to fulfill dreams, some to satisfy the hunger for wealth and power and some in search of acceptance in an altering world. A tryst with life and a celebration of love, the crime thriller is set at the dawn of a new beginning, bringing into its folds the commitments, responsibilities and perceptions that result from a serious theme attempted in a light environment. Flip through the pages to discover how the characters eventually let the threads roll out the paths of these new journeys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snapped Threads is a refreshing story about an art theft. It is brilliantly written in a very simplistic manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is surprising is that the story is written by a 16 year old girl. The knowledge that the author holds about art, exhibitions, and “the dark world” is commendable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book talks about love, friendship, betrayal, lust and greed for power and fame. How a person would go to any extent to fulfill his desires. It also stresses on the theme that a person with good intentions can make a bad person realise their mistakes and the harm they have caused to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development was excellent. How the characters are made to do things they would have never wanted to do just because someone was able to hit their weakest chord and manipulate them to do things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a mostly unpredictable story with lots of twists and turns.Though some stupid acts done by characters which were totally unreasonable and were disappointing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story was able to keep me hooked since beginning. As I progressed towards the end of the book, I was wondering whether the story is going to have a satisfactory end or am I going to be left at a cliffhanger. But I must say that the author gave an end to the story, which might slightly appear rushed up, but completes the story. A bit more details though would have made the book more loveable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for a refreshing read, with a good amount of thrill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/20/snapped-threads-by-riddhi-agarwal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/20/snapped-threads-by-riddhi-agarwal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Where The Forest Meets The Stars by Glendy Vanderah</title> <description>&lt;p&gt;THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;blurb-in-this-gorgeously-stunning-debut-a-mysterious-child-teaches-two-strangers-how-to-love-and-trust-again&quot;&gt;Blurb: In this gorgeously stunning debut, a mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again.&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the loss of her mother and her own battle with breast cancer, Joanna Teale returns to her graduate research on nesting birds in rural Illinois, determined to prove that her recent hardships have not broken her. She throws herself into her work from dusk to dawn, until her solitary routine is disrupted by the appearance of a mysterious child who shows up at her cabin barefoot and covered in bruises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girl calls herself Ursa, and she claims to have been sent from the stars to witness five miracles. With concerns about the child’s home situation, Jo reluctantly agrees to let her stay—just until she learns more about Ursa’s past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jo enlists the help of her reclusive neighbor, Gabriel Nash, to solve the mystery of the charming child. But the more time they spend together, the more questions they have. How does a young girl not only read but understand Shakespeare? Why do good things keep happening in her presence? And why aren’t Jo and Gabe checking the missing children’s website anymore?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the three have formed an incredible bond, they know difficult choices must be made. As the summer nears an end and Ursa gets closer to her fifth miracle, her dangerous past closes in. When it finally catches up to them, all of their painful secrets will be forced into the open, and their fates will be left to the stars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;My Review:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the story. It is fresh and keeps you hooked since the beginning. The plot is great about a girl coming from stars and making good things happen to good people. The writing style is brilliant and the story made me cry at more than one point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds the past of all the characters is bought to light. The reader understands the characters and their decisions. It makes you believe in trust and love. It makes you believe that good things happen to good people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The young girl, Ursa is wise beyond her years. She is smart and knows what she wants. She came looking for five miracles and with each miracle, she teaches us that life is full of wonders if you have an eye for it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title is very apt for the story. Jo works in the forest for her field study for research. So the forest plays a very important role in the story. Also, Ursa claims that she has come from stars. Hence that is another important aspect of the story. Where the Forest Meets the Stars, therefore, justifies the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </description> <pubDate>19 May 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/19/where-the-forest-meets-the-stars-by-glendy-vanderah/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/05/19/where-the-forest-meets-the-stars-by-glendy-vanderah/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Two Girls in Love by Ankita Singh</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Girls In Love is the story of a young, Indian woman, written in the form of poetic diary entries. It follows her journey from the moment she realizes that she’s free to be with whomever she wants to be with and that no law would stop her anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Girls In Love is short, like a few pages torn out of someone’s diary. But it tells a heartwarming tale of being true to yourself in a place where the people still may not be ready to accept you for who you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a story of hope, of love, of true friendships…it’s the story of two girls who are so in love with each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Two Girls in Love” is a story of girl, who introduces the readers to her sexuality, in form of poetic diary entries. The diary entry starts from the day when article 377 was struck down in India, giving LGBTQ community their well deserved rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple and decent. The protagonist’s confusion about her own sexuality, the fear and the sense of freedom are all cleary shown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed the shortness and the crispness of the story. It was to the point and kept up my interest till the last word.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended for a short and powerful read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Apr 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/07/two-girls-in-love-by-ankita-singh/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/07/two-girls-in-love-by-ankita-singh/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Nowhere by Chris Gill</title> <description>&lt;h4 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two boys. Two farms. One deadly secret.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Every day’s the same on the farm. Seventeen-year-old Seb rides his quad bike alongside his dad and cattle dog, dreaming about a different life. A life that doesn’t require him to spend all day in the blistering sun. Where the nearest town isn’t a forty-minute drive away with a population of fewer than three hundred people. Where he can talk to someone who isn’t his little brother or short-tempered father.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So when new neighbours move into the derelict farm on the opposite side of the shrub, Seb hopes his luck is finally about to change. Could Jake, the enigmatic boy with a dangerous glint in his eye, be his ticket out of The Nowhere? And if so, how far are they both willing to go to escape?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast forward two decades and Seb’s working as a nurse back in Perth. With his dad living in his home, Seb is tormented by the demons that have followed him his entire adult life. He begins confiding in his caring colleague Sandra, who convinces him the only way he’ll be able to move forward is to exorcise his ghosts and seek closure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when Jake calls out the blue telling Seb he’s coming to visit, Seb has to decide whether he’s ready to face exactly what happened that summer. On the night that forever changed not only the lives of the two boys, but that their entire families.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around a really interesting plot. Two kids dreaming of running away from their town – The Nowhere. But still not satisfied when they get what they have wanted for so long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story of one-sided love, family drama, friendship, teenage desires, and broken dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way the author transitioned to and fro past and present. Revealing just enough to keep the story going on while maintaining the curiosity of the reader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are great. They are influenced by their pasts but they are trying to get over it. Trying to get closure from their past. I think this is something which needs to be learned from the story. The past shape you, but you must not let the past have too much control over you. You need to understand the importance of letting things go. If you can’t change it, there is no use of regretting over it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for LGBTQ theme, less romance, and more drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Apr 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/06/the-nowhere-by-chris-gill/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/04/06/the-nowhere-by-chris-gill/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Kaleidoscope of Love by Priyanka Bhuyan</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Love, the strongest human emotion to ever exist. But what is love and why are its colour so myriad? Love can range from the purest form of mother’s love to the tragic feeling of unrequited love. And also to the silent love which continues even after it is gone. Love is basically like a kalaidescope and it changes colour in all human relations with time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaleidoscope Of Love is a collection of 10 short stories from fairy tale love to heartbreaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some stories are very sweet and makes you feel awestruck. I personally loved “O My Love It Was You!“. A guy who likes this girl, is doing whatever he can to woo her, directly or indirectly. It is cute and no doubt quite filmy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While on the other hand there is a story “Mirage and Reality“. The guy is desperate to feel loved. He rejects a girl (because (a) he has never met her before and his parents have fixed their marriage (b) she is too simple to be able to adjust in UK), then is rejected by his girlfriend (because she is not looking for marriage and is focusing on her career) and then rushes back to first girl to apologise and marry her (because he has to get married, no matter to whom).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On an overall level the stories are good, but had a scope for betterment. The stories are too short to connect at an emotional level. You don’t relate to the characters or their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/27/Kaleidoscope-of-Love-by-Priyanka-Bhuyan/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/27/Kaleidoscope-of-Love-by-Priyanka-Bhuyan/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Temple Origins by Chris Patt</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fate Sisters turn a promise into a curse, and the Bloodborne Legacy begins. Follow along as Death leads a young Mayan girl toward a sacred amulet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Temple Origins is a story about Almaya who is given a herculean task of protecting her tribe after the death of her sister, Patli by the Death itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being a trailer or an introductory book to the series, it did its work well. Introduction of characters is thoughtfully done. And their roles and responsibilities as per the plot of the story has been clearly defined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept is impressive and definitely makes me eager to read the first book of the series - Reign Drops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some errors in the text, which hindered my reading experience and I hope it won’t be so in the coming novels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>23 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/23/temple-origins-by-chris-patt/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/23/temple-origins-by-chris-patt/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Chance Encounter by Christi Whitson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy: What started as a writing exercise ended with me giving a hot guy a fake number. Not my finest hour. I never thought I’d see Donovan again, but he turned up in the most unlikely of places. And this time, he’s made it clear he has no intention of letting me get away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donovan: When I saw her in that cafe, my whole world shifted. I didn’t want to spend another second of my life not knowing her. She enchanted me from the very first glance, but almost every word from her lips was a lie. And when she gave me a fake name and vanished, it seemed fate was determined to make me a fool. When I finally found her again, the bombshell she dropped would’ve sent most men running. But I’m not most men. And even the mother of all roadblocks won’t stop me from claiming her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Author’s Note: Chance Encounter is a light-hearted, stand-alone contemporary romance with a HEA. You do not need to read the rest of the Fates Aligned series to enjoy the book. Be prepared for unexpected twists, a moderate helping of steamy goodness, and a sweet book-boyfriend with a dirty mouth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story revolves around themes such as friendship, love, sacrifice and motherhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are awesome and immediately lovable. They are realistically developed. They deal with good and bad, truths and lies, in a way any real person would actually do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t expect much twists and turns. It is a straight forward cheesy romance story involving a ‘tadka’ of family drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is fast paced but maintains its quality throughout. Though I expected a little more of ‘scenes’ at the end which would make me feel emotionally connected to Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a light romance read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/15/chance-encounter-by-christi-whitson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/15/chance-encounter-by-christi-whitson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Rural Coincidence</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are village folks really that simple? What happens when rural people start gambling on drugs? Can a small girl from a village break the existing social stigma and become ‘modern’? Are love stories restricted to urban areas? Do genetics play a role in shaping decisions related to mischief? To what length can a father go to get his daughter the more important things in life? Can fulfillment come without education? Read this riveting short story of twists and turns in a village depicting the life of a farmer, his family and the village postman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Rural Coincidence is an exciting journey of a farmer, his family, and the village postman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I started reading it, I had no clue what to expect from the story. But what came was a surprising story about the intricacies of the minds of the village people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a fun short read. Though it had some grammatical errors but that does not deter the reader from enjoying the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend buying a Kindle edition of the book as I feel it would give more worth to the money spent than a physical book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/a-rural-coincidence-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/a-rural-coincidence-by-debjeet-mukherjee/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Zomu and the Big-Head by K.

He goes to a place he had never been to; there he meets ‘The Big-head’. He is the mystic, the magician. Zomu knows ‘the big-head’ has all the answers, and ‘the big-head’ knows, Zomu has all the right questions. Both of them had waited for each other, all their life. But Zomu is afraid and shy of asking out all those right questions. The big head, the all-knowing; has some unheard of methods to get inside Zomu’s small head and get those questions out. The drama, the mystery, the thrill, and bundle of emotions unfold as ‘the big-head’ try out his unheard of methods on Zomu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zomu and the Big-head is an interesting story based on real life incident which is told about at the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story about substance abuse, addiction and a psycho killer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially starting as a simple story of a shy guy Zomu, going to bank to open an account, you gradually realise there is something more to it. Incidents start to catch your attention as you begin to realise that something peculiar is going on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an unconventional, and an intriguing story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/Zomu-and-the-big-head-by-ks-das/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/08/Zomu-and-the-big-head-by-ks-das/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Divyastra by Nimish Tanna</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thousands of years ago, Indian Yogis possessed the knowledge to obtain the weapons of the gods. However, this knowledge could only be transferred from a Guru to his disciple by word of mouth. In today’s world, one mystic, who calls himself Guruji, still possesses this knowledge and is using it to empower an innocent person’s life. Only, this empowerment could be a deception and the innocent person is a thirteen year old boy with a stutter… In this intertwining tale, an ambitious yet unsuccessful Shankar, in search of his identity, is manipulated to embark on a never-told-before fantasy tale; only to rediscover the father he never knew and unmask the mystical Guruji. Amidst this confounding concoction of ancient myths, deluding personas and dispersed emotions, will Shankar ever be able to separate fact from fiction and find his true identity?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A mix of mythology, fantasy and science, Divyastra takes you on a journey full of myths and facts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has put in a lot of efforts in research about the astras and shastras. And that is definitely visible as the story progresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is quite a different read than what people are used to reading under the genre of fantasy. I was not really a fan of this genre but the story genuinely interested me. It hooks you up from chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The way the story unfolds is very clever and smartly executed. Unpredictable twists and turns keeps you eager to read more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are fan of Hindu mythology or not, this novel will make you enjoy every second you put into it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/07/divyastra-by-nimish-tanna/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/07/divyastra-by-nimish-tanna/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Dark Side Of The Moon by Shubham Arora</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Dark Side Of The Moon is a collection of short stories that are dark, grim and flirt ambitiously with notions of the unexplained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volume 1 includes three fast paced stories which are bound to keep you hooked -&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;THE LAST SKYPE: What do you do when you are thousands of miles away from the person you love? You Skype. But what if what you see isn’t what it actually is?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IN MY HEAD: All killers have a motive. People don’t kill out of necessity; people kill because they want to kill. Would a mother murdering her own child have a motive too? He has seven days to find out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;THE RITUAL: It’s been 33 years. The comet is returning. His god is returning. The time is right for The Ritual. Will his god come home?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;All the three stories deal in the depths of mind. They are something which you wouldn’t want to agree with readily (being educated enough, questioning the unseeable, and believing in logics) but also they are something which is not clearly deniable. If we have a peek into the past, we can come up with several such incidences, which deny logic and science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I appreciate the way, the author chose this theme, keeping it both believably true and unbelievably spooky and unnatural.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title justifies the 3 stories. “The Dark Side Of The Moon” which is not visible, but is there. As complex and unnatural the changing shapes of the moon is despite us knowing the science of it, so are the three stories of this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Definitely recommended if you are looking for short, spooky reads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/03/The-Dark-Side-Of-The-Moon-by-Shubham-Arora/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/03/The-Dark-Side-Of-The-Moon-by-Shubham-Arora/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Nightmarescape by Jonathan Fortin</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bliss is a city of nightmares, and all Grace wants is to get her daughter out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years ago, the residents of Bliss discovered that their nightmares were becoming real. Ever since, the city has steadily transformed into a surreal, twisted hellscape. Massive walls trap the residents in with bloodthirsty monsters and indescribable terrors. No one knows if it’s even possible to escape alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace, an African-American mother, spends her days searching for a way out of the city to give her daughter Sam a chance at a real future. But when Sam is kidnapped by a shadow from their past, mother and daughter alike are forced to face their greatest fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although it is a short story, the author was able to touch upon all the details required to weave this story. From describing the situation of the city, Bliss (which is quite ironical, because bliss means perfect happiness, while the city is filled with the terror of nightmares) as in present vs. how it was initially, to the people facing the terror of nightmares and finally to the scene in which Sam is kidnapped and then what happens later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything is vividly described and I can just imagine what a great movie can be made based on this story. Quite similar to yet a lot different from the theme of “Birdbox”, this short story is capable of being made into a long length novel as well as movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were definitely certain parts in the story which could have been written in a more descriptive manner, but owing to the short length of the story I don’t mind missing onto such details.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you liked “Birdbox” - either movie or book, then this 16 pages long story would definitely interest you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/02/nightmarescape-by-jonathan-fortin/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/02/nightmarescape-by-jonathan-fortin/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Surviving McCoy by EK McCoy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up, my sisters and I played rough, and throughout the years we were known to have several fist fights. A day didn’t pass without one of us ending up with a new scratch or bruise, and we certainly had our fair share of stitches. We were always covered in dirt. We played and fought like boys, but we held grudges and sought revenge like girls. Our grandfather Poppy gave us the nickname The McCoy Boys. Looking back, I wish us McCoy Boys would have known what we know now—that life really does pass in the blink of an eye, and throughout your life friends will come and go, but you’ll always have your family. Those moments when we all got along and acted like not only friends but sisters who loved and cared for one another were some of the best moments of my life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surviving McCoy is a mostly true memoir of the life of the author. It is the journey of the author, from her birth till after her marriage and having 2 kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being the youngest of the three sisters she has faced a fair (I would rather say unfair) share of bully. Like in any other household, Em, the youngest sister is being bullied by her 2 elder sisters, Charlie and Liz. But I think these girls took sisterly fights to another level. She wouldn’t even dare to complain about her sisters’ deeds to her parents since she was so scared of them. I frankly have not witnessed such behaviour in my or my friends’ or relatives’ houses. Hence, I found the behaviour of Charlie rather more deregotary than what the author must have aimed to show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the parents seem quite ignorant about the behaviour of their kids. My mom would have taken a good class of me and my sister had we done anything close to what the McCoy boys were upto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gradually, as the McCoy boys grow up, and separate from their home for higher studies, they realise each other’s values in their lives. They realise the importance of their sisters and parents. They find out how pure and unconditional the love of a family is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It not only talks about relationship with sister and parents but also grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, boyfriends and husbands. Each relationship in its truest sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an innocent compilation of the memorable moments of the authors life. And I must say I enjoyed this journey. It is a light read. It feels like you are talking to a friend who is complaining about her sister and family. And you are just like “I know right. I feel you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended If you think that your relationship with your siblings is bad. If you think that parenting is difficult. If you think being a single parent is much more difficult. If you think your kids are a pain in the ass. This book will definitely make you feel better about your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>01 Mar 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/01/surviving-mccoy-by-ek-mccoy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/03/01/surviving-mccoy-by-ek-mccoy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Peach by Wayne Barton</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;.Following the untimely passing of a close friend, British songwriter and producer, Freddie Ward, arrives in Bliss, Idaho to work on a comeback album with beloved singer-songwriter, Hal Granger. Adrift and bereft, Freddie is looking to gain a sense of perspective after a series of bad decisions—decisions that cost him his relationship and life as he knows it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, almost as soon as Freddie arrives in Idaho, Hal drops an unexpected and devastating bombshell. Far from the hustle and bustle of his life in England, out in the stark isolation of the northwestern U.S., with time to think, to reflect, Freddie slowly begins to rebuild his life, haunted both by the events of the recent past and his reactions to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peach is a very beautifully written novel and an instant classic. It allows the reader to think about their lives as the author takes us on the journey of Freddie’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very simplistically and realistically executed, Peach, talks about the struggles in the life of an artist or any other normal person. Inability to focus, blaming others and finding excuses while procrastinating the work. Not just the work related struggles, but struggles in maintaining relationships, romantic or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The entire novel feels like an experience. As if you are talking to your grandparents. You try to understand what they are speaking because it contains a lot more meaning than its words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel hits the right chord of readers’ hearts in such a way that you won’t even realise. It is a story which will stay with you for years to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you are looking for a slow, and simple story, trying to deal with the high-lows of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/27/peach-by-wayne-barton/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/27/peach-by-wayne-barton/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she’ll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart, warm, uplifting, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . the only way to survive is to open your heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially you find Eleanor a very dumb character. She is a thirty year something old woman who seems to have no idea of the world around her. She doesn’t know the difference between a computer, a laptop and a tablet, when she herself is an finance clerk whose 9-5 job revolves around a computer screen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as the story unfolds you get to know about Eleanor’s past bit by bit. You understand why she acts the way she do. You feel bad for her and for what she is going through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raymond comes as a light of hope in the dark and dull life of Eleanor. As they get more friendly, he realises that there is something wrong in Eleanor’s life and does his best to make it better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a heartbreaking story about a girl who has always been told that she is not good enough. It is a story of true friendship and relations which are thicker than blood. It is a story of a loner who realises that you need to surround yourself with the people who love you unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The end takes an unpredictable turn making the reader take Eleanor’s entire journey on a more serious note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautifully written story which is heart touching and definitely makes you fall in love with its characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>22 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/22/Eleanor-Oliphant-is-Completely-Fine-by-Gail-Honeyman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/22/Eleanor-Oliphant-is-Completely-Fine-by-Gail-Honeyman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>No Solicitors by John Callas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lewis Cutterman is a well respected brain surgeon and happliy married with two beautiful children who run the family business. They are model citizens within the community. A simple visit to their home by a beautiful saleswoman is greeted by an invitation to dinner. But dinner takes a deadly turn when the woman finds herself drugged by the family. Waking up in a basement, strapped to an operating table, and surrounded by other prisoners of the Cutterman family, she quickly discovers that their captors intend to remove and sell their internal organs on the black market. And then to get rid of the evidence, they will all be slowly eaten, piece… by … piece.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is one of the most scary, dark, torturous and egregious novels I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well I don’t know if it should be called a good book or a bad one. Bad because it is so gross that you sometimes wish to drop it. And good because it comes up so graphically gross that you sometimes wish to drop it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is very smartly written that you want to curse the characters and kill them and let them burn in hell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended if you can read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DARE: Watch the movie. (Though I haven’t watched it but since the movie is directed by the author himself you can just imagine how hard he might have worked to create his vision.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/09/no-solicitors-by-john-callas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/09/no-solicitors-by-john-callas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Dreaming of Tomorrow by V. R. Baucke</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are moments in my life I wish I could alter, take back… re-do. One do-over changed my world more than I could imagine. Emily. Six weeks ago she crashed into my life without warning, alleviated my burdens, then wrenched out my heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Austin McKenna battled for years to live up to impossible expectations. Emily Dixon showed him what it was like to love and be loved unconditionally, accepting and understanding him in his entirety. Never had Austin experienced a longing or loss that compared to losing her. She was the first woman he willingly bore his soul to, and now he was determined to claim her back once and for all… No matter the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike the first installment of the duet - Living for Today, which was written with the point of view of Emily, Dreaming of Tomorrow is written with the point of view of Austin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This time Austin travels all the way from San Francisco to New Zealand just to see his love after long months of separation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author is able to maintain same level of interest in this book as in the first one. The characters have developed in a great way over the course of time. 2 philophobic people falling in love with each other, the constant fear of their respective exes, worries of their parents are all very beautifully shown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending seemed rushed up. Looks like the author did not spend much time on the closure of the past of both Emily and Austin. I was expecting more by the time I finished the book. I personally loved 1st book better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you are looking for just a cute romance then I would recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>07 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/07/dreaming-of-tomorrow-by-vr-baucke/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/07/dreaming-of-tomorrow-by-vr-baucke/</guid> </item> <item> <title>You Begin Where I End by Sarang Jairaj</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to love two people at the same time?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nafisa is dealing with beers, periods, heartbreak, and dating apps, when she meets her new uniquely average boyfriend. But is he the love of her life? Before Nafisa can figure that out, her life is turned upside down. Her mother Tamanna dies in an accident. In trying to come to terms with her loss, she finds solace in the company of a charming painter. Her life takes a retro turn, with diaries, handwritten letters, and music trying to heal her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tamanna is busy simply existing and complaining, when a gorgeous poet takes her on a whirlwind philosophical journey, teaching her to appreciate art, nature, human existence, and love. But is he the love of her life? Before Tamanna can figure that out, her marriage is arranged with an extraordinarily ordinary guy. Amidst arranged marriages, honour killings, letters of blood, and melting ice-golas, Tamanna shall discover her brand of love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You Begin Where I End spins two unconventional love stories, set two decades apart – 1991 and 2015 – trying to find an answer to the eternal dilemma of darlings – What is love?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved how the author is able to weave the story of two different worlds in such a beautiful way. Each words seeps into your heart and grows to become a tree of thoughts, branching into different possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simple joys of an average girl are gloriously shown like sitting on the window side of a bus, star gazing and silent walks with your love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the book was what kept me hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of references of things without using their names for example - ‘an app that sounds like hinder’ was a bit pesky. It is pretty obvious what it is being referred to, and naming it directly wouldn’t have hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the different definitions of love as provided by author. Everyone has different meanings, different understanding about love. And no one is wrong, which is cleverly shown in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t mind saying it is a uniquely average book and I would definitely recommend it for a light read. Such book, much love&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;P.S. Don’t judge the book by its cover. The girl in the cover is not at all the fat girl who describes herself as panda in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Feb 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/04/you-begin-where-i-end-by-sarang-jairaj/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/02/04/you-begin-where-i-end-by-sarang-jairaj/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Take My Heart Forever by Arpit Agrawal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Siddhartha, a good lawyer but a bad human.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meet Rahul, a good human but a bad doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And meet Shuchi, a good human and an exceptionally well doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shuchi tries to make a good human out of Siddhartha and a good doctor out of Rahul, but a bomb blast transforms their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Read this revolutionary tale to know how Siddhartha will get a unique PIL passed in the courtroom and Rahul will perform a life changing surgery, to save the girl they love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take my heart, forever is a beautifully written, and simple story involving realistic characters. It takes us through one of the most horrific incidents faced by India - the Mumbai bomb blast. The author takes the reader on an emotional journey of poor medical condition of India, injustice by the hands of the rich and powerful, and terrorism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is definitely heart touching and makes the reader beg for a reform in our country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want powerful and smart lawyers like Siddhartha given that they fight not for money but for the righteousness. We want doctors like Shuchi who devote themselves selflessly for treatment of the underprivileged. We want humans like Rahul who can restore humanity in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a lot to be learned from this story, a lot to work upon for the betterment of our country, and a lot to be disccused and debated amongst the citizens but gradually accepted and implemented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I highly recommend this novel to the readers from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/27/take-my-heart-forever-by-arpit-agrawal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/27/take-my-heart-forever-by-arpit-agrawal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Underdog Parade by Michael Mihaley</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the summer of the drought, a boy must decide if his neighbor’s ark is lunacy or a lifeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the summer of the drought, but thirteen-year-old Peter “Nemo” Grady has bigger problems on his mind than the weather. He hates his new home in the exclusive golf club community Willow Creek Landing. His parents are always fighting and he can’t escape the memory of his last seizure—when he flopped around the gymnasium floor like a fish out of water—earning him his dreaded nickname. To top it all off, Peter has no friends, but he receives plenty of unsolicited attention from Chipper, the boy scout super-bully who also happens to be a resident of Willow Creek. His only companion is his little sister, CJ, who thinks she is Wonder Woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peter is all too aware that you don’t need rain in the forecast to have dark clouds overhead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Things change when he meets his new neighbor, the mysterious Joshua, who predicts the drought will end with a storm of biblical proportions. Peter looks to his visiting, wheelchair-bound Uncle Herb, and his neighbors, Mr. James and Mr. Terry, for guidance as Josh prepares for imminent doom. With each passing day, Peter realizes that sooner or later he will have to rely on the strength of the lamest, most jelly-weak individual he knows—himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really liked the plot of the story. It revolves around themes like bully, adjustment problems at a new place, living with a person with disability, family problems etc. It is simple and can even be read to students since there is a lot to learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each character was given equal space to present themselves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Characters are developed very intricately and realistically. You can actually connect to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Story is slow. I got through the book at a very low speed. It was difficult to keep up the interest for a long time. But it was able to hook me by the last few chapters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you can keep up with a slow paced but a good story, then I would recommend this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/24/the-underdog-parade-by-michael-mihaley/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/24/the-underdog-parade-by-michael-mihaley/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Words of Void by Sandhiya Palanisamy</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of void is a collection of poetry, prose and quotes about life. It explores around pain, love, heart break and happiness of people who wanna change themselves but also tired of society wanting them to stay where they are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of void takes you through the journey of the darkness of life and finds still light in them, because if you keep moving forward there is light at the end of every tunnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Words of Void is a beautiful collection of quotes, poetries and proses. Written from the point of view of a girl, who is oppressed and assaulted. A girl, whose dreams are shattered and has been abused.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The theme revolves around love, lust, pain, sexual assault and dreams broken by family and society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The words are written from heart and reaches the heart of readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the simplicity with which the writer has expressed herself. There is a lot to be read between the lines, to be discussed and to ponder upon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there were many grammatical errors which spoiled the wonderful experience of getting connected to the words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proses and quotes are great ideas to be used as prompts if you like to write or want to start the habit of writing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/Words-of-Void-by-Sandhiya-Palanisamy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/Words-of-Void-by-Sandhiya-Palanisamy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Watchmaker and Time by Devang Kanavia</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pedro’s love for watches was born out of a strange incident in his childhood.

Join this watchmaker in his enriching and thought provoking journey in search of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Watchmaker and Time is a beautifully written story which talks about the philosophy of time and eternity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It enlightens us about the complicated questions about time while letting the reader ponder upon what the author has to say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is written in a very simplistic manner which makes it easy to understand. It is a very touching story and leaves an impression on the reader for “ETERNITY”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a short read recommended for readers of all ages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/the-watchmaker-and-time-by-devang-kanavia/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/20/the-watchmaker-and-time-by-devang-kanavia/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Anonymous by Nidhi Kukreja</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As I sat down, my eyes rested on the envelope lying on the doormat, For Natasha, the writing on it said. I panicked, this cant is him again! I hurriedly opened it and his words made me cry out loud.” The Anonymous is the story of Natasha, a victim of sexual violence, assault, harassment, and rape, who was a happy, cheerful girl, but she is now cold, heartbroken and weak! During her recovery, she was dragged into a vicious cycle of nightmares by the letters, that just wouldn’t let her move on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Dreams are woven and seamed when the bloodsheds”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the path we move on is always not easy; Hurdles, difficulties, issues, problems bring you down, but the inspiration and spirit to go ahead keep you focused and determined. It is not easy, sometimes we get lost and trapped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is she trapped by it? Or is she forced into a cycle of self-harm and depression? Is it a fight to survive? Is there really no escaping the past?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hello. Don’t put the book down just yet, pick it. You are welcome to my world.” - The Anonymous&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is very thoughtfully written. The writing style is sophisticated. The transitions from present to past are made very clearly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plight of a rape victim (read: survivor) was presented with such veracity that it makes the reader feel the pain of Natasha. The letters by The Anonymous cringes the reader as if they themselves have received it. You not only visualise the story, but somewhere in the journey become a part of their story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters were not perfect. No one is. And this is the best part of a book, where everyone’s weaknesses and darksides are shown and worked upon throughout their journey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story talks about changes. How some incidents can change lives of people and people themselves. How a friend becomes stranger and strangers become your lifeline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplicity of the story touched my heart and will remain there forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>10 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/10/the-anonymous-by-nidhi-kukreja/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/10/the-anonymous-by-nidhi-kukreja/</guid> </item> <item> <title>PiKu &amp; ViRu by Priyanka Agarwal</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A traumatising theft on assignment leaves twenty-eight-year-old content writer Piyanjali Kumari with this crazy epiphany. Her numerous attempts to meet TV heartthrob Vian Rustom go in vain. That’s when her guardian angel tells her the one thing she needs to do to make things happen. Desperate, she takes the plunge. But sh*t keeps going wrong. And PiKu realises her story with ViRu is destined to end in only one way—heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will PiKu be able to win ViRu’s love? Will she get the romance of her dreams? Or will it be the darkest nightmare of her life?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;PiKu &amp;amp; ViRu is an emotional roller coaster that promises to take you places.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story line is very unique. It is presented in a very realistic way. Every person having a crush on a celebrity can very well relate to the emotions of PiKu. Though quite real on PiKu’s part, the story shows the negative side of celebrities through ViRu’s character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way in which the author has been able to present PiKu’s guardian angel as a guide who doesn’t give away much (more like gut feeling and intuition).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is simple yet compelling. The story is easy to dive into. It is not very predictable and keeps you hooked to know what happens next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>05 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/05/piku-and-viru-by-priyanka-agarwal/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/05/piku-and-viru-by-priyanka-agarwal/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Perfect Imperfections by Taryn Leigh</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah Lewis desires nothing more than to begin again after a failed marriage and a tragedy so terrifying, it forces her to leave her life in London to stay with her best friend a world apart in South Africa. Despite immediate success in her business, she struggles to understand who she really is and where she belongs in the world. So begins a journey of discovery as Sarah re-unites with Katy in the land where she was born, where the air is lavender scented, and weekends are spent cycling on the beach.Until the day when she has to return to London to face the ghosts of her past and confront a situation that has grown more complicated in her absence.Perfect Imperfections is an intriguing tale which hints at wrongdoings and deceit without giving too much away. The author cleverly weaves a tale around fragile yet strong Sarah as she tries to reconcile her past with her future, engaging the reader to the point where we simply want the best for her and for happiness finally to come her way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perfect Imperfections is a very easy going story. Though slow in the beginning, it grabs your interest midway and never disappoints. It is not a book with surprising twists and turns. It is very predictable, but the cute moments in the book are what keeps you going.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story seems very realistic. The struggles as well as the reactions to situations are mostly very real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The characters are very likely and I would love to have them as friends in real life. They are supportive to each other and gives true friendship goals. Character Development is very beautifully done especially for Sarah. Though she is left heart broken due to her past she comes out stronger with much more determination and sense of purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is smooth and very easy to get into.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recommended for a light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jan 2019</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/03/Perfect-Imperfections-by-Taryn-Leigh/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2019/01/03/Perfect-Imperfections-by-Taryn-Leigh/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Living for Today by V. R. Baucke</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a lonely world when the ever present ghosts of my past refused to lie dormant. They blemished all that was beautiful in my world, tainting and tarnishing even the simplest of memories. Deep-rooted. Lingering. …Unseen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emily Dixon knew what it was like to bury a secret deep within her innermost soul. There, its power was removed. Confined. Ignored. All remained hidden until Emily travelled seven thousand miles across the world and unexpectedly collided with Austin McKenna… The very man who blew both her secrets and heart out of the water while trying to piece her back together again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Living For Today is a story written with the perspective of Emily, who travels from her home in New Zealand to her friend’s in San Francisco to celebrate Thanksgiving, where she meets Austin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“And then love happens at the most unexpected place with the most unexpected person.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Emily and Austin have had a fair share of a bad past. But they both open up to each other in a way neither could have in front of anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is cute young adult romance and an easy going story. It has a lot of mushy moments which I don’t usually enjoy, but I actually enjoyed this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very elegantly written book. It gives away a lot without giving away much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/28/living-for-today-by-vr-baucke/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/28/living-for-today-by-vr-baucke/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Similars by Rebecca Hanover</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This fall, six new students are joining the junior class at the elite Darkwood Academy. But they aren’t your regular over-achieving teens. They’re DNA duplicates, and these “similars” are joining the class alongside their originals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Similars are all anyone can talk about. Who are they? What are the odds that all of them would be Darkwood students? And who is the madman who broke the law to create them? Emmaline Chance could care less. Her best friend, Oliver, died over the summer and it’s all she can do to get through each day without him. Then she comes face-to-heartbreaking-face with Levi, Oliver’s exact DNA copy and one of the Similars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emma wants nothing to do with the Similars, but she keeps getting pulled deeper into their world. She can’t escape the dark truths about them or her prestigious school. No one can be trusted, not even the boy she is falling for with Oliver’s face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Six clones. One elite boarding school. Countless deadly secret.” The plot of the novel is very intimidating. It is quite new and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about an “accidental” experiment where DNA of six new born babies were taken (read: stolen) and used to make their clones. These clones (the Similars) were bought up on a man-made island by Augustus Gravelle. The Similars joined the same school as their originals (Darkwood Academy) which led to anti-similars and pro-similars group formation .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story spoke of acceptance, friendship, love and loneliness in a beautiful way. The story was excellent and it unfolded in a very structured manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there were a lot of drawbacks. The same facts were repeated over and over making it boring sometimes. (But it was also helpful a few times since you didn’t have to turn pages to understand references) On the other hand enough reasons or facts were not provided for important events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist – Emmaline Chance was a really dumb character who did the all the correct things only because (a) she is the protagonist and (b) the author knows what she is supposed to do. Some wrong decisions made by a character makes it more realistic. Which was not the case with Emmaline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was abrupt and kept me hanging on several points. I can only wish that the novel has a sequel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>27 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/27/The-Similars-by-Rebecca-Hanover/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/27/The-Similars-by-Rebecca-Hanover/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Lake Beneath the Station by Multiple Authors</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lake Beneath the Station is a collection of stories that is sure to send shivers down your spine and give you sleepless nights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In these tales of love gone mad and ghostly romance, you will encounter characters that frighten yet enchant you. You will read stories that will make you want to look away, to go back to the light, and to the things that you know and trust…but the book will not let you go…instead you will read on, going deeper and deeper into The Lake Beneath the Station.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lake Beneath the Station is published by Hippo Books, a publisher dedicated to producing interesting, readable and fun books. This book is suitable for English students with upper-intermediate English or higher. Be sure to check out our other Hippo Graded Readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lake Beneath the Station is a collection of 6 phantom stories. Each unique in its own way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are written in simple English language (meant for the benefit of English learners - beginners level).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stories are based on unrealistic ideas. Although most of the stories revolve around ghostly and paranormal plots, they are not scary. Instead they can be called goofy.(Recommended for weak hearted :-P )&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best part about this collection of stories is that even though they are simplistically written, each story unfolds unpredictabily. These stories are suitable for all ages. It is a short and light read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would really recommend this book to everyone, especially the language learners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/24/The-Lake-Beneath-the-Station/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/24/The-Lake-Beneath-the-Station/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Diary on the Fifth Floor by Raisha Lalwani</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A woman leaves her infant at home but finds her on a busy street in an unexpected turn of events. Another woman wakes up in a flight hours later, befuddled, in the strangest circumstance. A fascinating tale of a twenty-five-year-old woman that takes hold of us from the moment she enters the fifth floor of a hospital; more precisely, the psychiatric ward. Visibly terrified, she clutches at her clothbound diary, caught in the horns of a terrible dilemma—whether or not to hand over the diary to the doctor. She fears that she will be declared insane if her tangled web of thoughts unspooling in dark mysterious stories is read by the dissecting eye of a doctor. What does this diary contain? As the novel progresses, we are drawn into characters and stories that are toe-curling, strange, and haunting in their raw intensity. What is the story of this woman? What secrets lie in the pages of her diary? And most importantly, what happens on the fifth floor?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Diary on the Fifth Floor is a story about a young lady Savannah Khanna who is visiting a psychiatrist. Savannah is initially reluctant to see one but gradually open ups to the doctor and shows her the diary in which she writes shorts stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These entries emphasises on the negative side of the society. Breakups, thefts, murders and abortions are the major topics around which the entries revolve. The diary entries show us a very real face of the society. The face which is usually seen in the newspaper headlines, heard on television as breaking news. The observations made by Savannah or we can say the author (Raisha Lalwani) are critical and brutally honest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even after several attempts made by the psychiatrist to introduce Savannah to the positive side of world, it is difficult for Savannah to accept the same, owing to her past memories since her childhood. And we can’t blame her for her perspective of world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raisha Lalwani has adopted a really simple yet a mesmerizing style of writing. The stories ends on unpredictable notes and makes you crave for more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I loved the way the stories were written. As if questioning the society. Showing a mirror to the society and warning them to stop before the scenario worsens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would like to give a disclaimer if you are thinking about reading this book. Don’t hope to find positivity in the stories. Doing so will just make you feel worse about the world and the society you live in. Think of the book as a critique, which is finding faults in you, the society and the world and you as an individual need to work on improving yourself and hence the world. “Change begins with you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/18/The-Diary-on-the-Fifth-Floor-by-Raisha-Lalwani/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/18/The-Diary-on-the-Fifth-Floor-by-Raisha-Lalwani/</guid> </item> <item> <title>54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew! by Swati Lodha and Swaraa Lodha</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book is a tongue in cheek take on things parents should and should not do. It talks about various beliefs, behaviour and biases held by most parents that make them annoying and difficult. So, all you parents out there—be a good sport, pick up this book and see for yourself the heart of a teenager. 54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew! will leave you with one big reason to understand your child, all over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew…” The book gets you all excited merely by its title.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although I had all my reasons listed in my mind about why parents suck, I wanted to know what this mother - daughter duo has to say about parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I never knew that the problems I face with my parents are so universal. It was so realistic that at no point I could say that it never happened to me or this is so unrealistic. NEVER.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I found the thoughts haphazardly written but I grew used to the style which was actually very interesting to read. The analogies were apt and again, relatable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have always felt closest to my sister in my entire social circle. We argue and we fight but we share our deepest concerns, our worries, thoughts and ideas with each other. And reading this book was like just another of our discussions where we speak, we listen, we understand and never judge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book made me cry and it made me laugh. It made me hate my parents and it made me love them more. It was a rollercoaster ride in true terms tantalized by the idea of perfect parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well! Nobody is perfect. Neither are we nor are our parents. Only if we both realise our weaknesses, we have a scope for improvement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reading the book you just have two options in front of you Confront your parents and improve your relations Pick the smallest of their issues, argue and worsen your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1st option is not an easy one. It will take time. But will definitely keep your family happier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>16 Dec 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/16/54-reasons-why-parents-suck-and-Phew-by-Swati-Lodha-and-Swaraa-Lodha/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/12/16/54-reasons-why-parents-suck-and-Phew-by-Swati-Lodha-and-Swaraa-Lodha/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Faith's Eternal Sunshine by Aashish Gupta</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP YOUR FAITH IF YOU WERE TRAPPED FOREVER?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manjiri, a devout atheist, is meeting her friend Manu after 20 years. Their conversation soon turns into an argument over God’s existence, and its nature. What seemed to be a harmless debate becomes Manjiri’s worst nightmare when she is trapped by Manu in a cell. Are Manu’s intentions malign or is this some weird test of faith? Take a seat, buckle your belt, as you set yourself on the world’s most claustrophobic, yet enlightening, journey of Manjiri. Be prepared to see life in a radically different way with this bold, edge of the seat thriller.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faith’s Eternal Sunshine is an interesting story that questions the existence of God but also explains the existence of a Higher Power. It preaches faith rather than religion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is a much more practical and realistic version of “The Secrets” by Rhonda Byrne.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faith’s Eternal Sunshine teaches us the following lesson through the medium of a story of Manjiri and Manu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1) Happiness comes with pain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can never savour the taste of happiness until you have tasted pain. Seeing the pain of others we realise how fortunate we are for not being in that situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2) Certainity of death makes relationships stronger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I knew someone is immortal and will stay as it is forever, I will start getting envious of it. Our relationship will start degrading to an extent that I will have nothing but hatred for that person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3) Death is end. But endings are beautiful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Life is good with all its colours, black and white, joys and sorrows, but until the artwork is finished no one applauds. Death was that final stroke on canvas.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4) Have faith in the Higher Power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Believe in the existence of that power from the core of your heart. You need to realise that the Higher Power wants your well being and everything happens for a reason. Be grateful for every little thing you have in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5) Miracle happens&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is that miracles are mostly small, sometimes so infinitely small that they pass unobserved. A miracle could be as small as triggering something that may not fulfil the wish of a believer but makes them stronger in the path of fulfilling that wish.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(And I believe it because I have experienced it personally.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Checkout the story of miracle in my life here:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do miracles happen? by Falguni Jain&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of learnings in this novel. Every sentence has a deeper meaning which has to be read, understood and applied to one’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some grammatical errors, otherwise it no doubt deserves a 5-on-5 rating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>15 Nov 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/15/Faiths-Eternal-Sunshine-by-Aashish-Gupta/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/15/Faiths-Eternal-Sunshine-by-Aashish-Gupta/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Chasing Ivy by S.J. Sylvis</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, I had a best friend with sky-blue eyes, purposefully messy brown hair, and a body that made every single girl drool on sight. I would know—it drove me absolutely crazy…until I was the one doing the drooling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our days were filled with stomach-hurting laughter accompanied by easy conversation, and our nights were filled with secret, awkward teenage flirting. But that was when Dawson was just my best friend. Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then… it was more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a memory I pretend to see through blurry eyes, hazed by passing years of no communication. The one night that my heart was suddenly soaring through the starry night, only to catch fire as it rapidly descended seconds later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years was a long time to get my heart under control. A lot has changed, and yet here I am, still drooling over Dawson—my ex best friend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a typical teenage romance. Ivy and Dawson are best friends but deep inside they know they love each other more than just as best friends. They do not want to accept it because they are scared that they might lose their friendship as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is very innocent and characters cute. Ivy is a strong girl. She has grown beyond her age because of the happenings that took place in her life. Dawson though is a perfect lover but becomes quite obsessive about ivy sometimes. But it is cute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I found the plot simple and predictable. But the writing style was good. It was funny and enjoyable. But at various points I felt lack of emotions. The characters ‘chuckled’ and ‘laughed’ at serious moments, when they should have been crying or yelling at other. This took away the power of the scene and made it look bland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt mixed emotions while reading the book. Sometimes I was laughing like a mad person while at other times I was literally yelling in my mind “Can you guys just stop laughing till you sort your issues?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would recommend it for a light mushy romance read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Nov 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/09/chasing-ivy-by-sj-sylvis/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/11/09/chasing-ivy-by-sj-sylvis/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Once Upon A Time by Saurav Chhawchharia</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loving is never easy. No, not loving your girlfriend. That’s easy. But loving your dreams when you have nothing and are losing from everywhere.One moment, everything seems to be going so good, so apt, so right. Another, everything vanishes into thin air. And that, my friend, is horrifying!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samar Kaushik, a daydreamer and a nerdish high-school guy pens a novel based partly on his own past life and partly on his fancies, portraying himself as a celebrated writer having a gorgeous girlfriend and bundles of bucks!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sahil is fifteen, sells toys at traffic signals and throws hard questions on the utility of surnames and the education system. Rizwan who serves cutting chai at squares dreams of becoming a footballer. Abdul is contented with life and is thankful that a folk has volunteered to teach them how to operate a computer when comes a day to put everything to an end and they realize that dreams can’t replicate each and everything like they do in those motivational stories and there are some constrains which poverty lays for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is inscribed in their destiny? Will anyone win at their dreams? If yes, who?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is intense yet light, dark but witty, deep yet funny. One that brings out a heartbreaking conflict between our expectations from life and its unpleasant reality on one hand, whereas on the other, also advocates its beautiful side beyond the deceptive world of fake relations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once Upon A Time is a beautiful story focusing on lifestyle of slum dwellers. It also talks about the struggles of aspiring writers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the concepts were nice the story could have been made into two different stories instead of one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were stories within these two major stories. Grandmother’s stories as well as the story of two different novels by two different characters. Initially I thought that the writer won’t be able to do justice to the plot, but I must say that the plot was very clear and the stories were distinguishable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some characters who were introduced but vanished suddenly and entered again later with no clear background about their time during that period. It was difficult to keep an eye on the activities of each character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some places I felt like the thoughts of the writer were not organised. A very haphazard description of events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is not a story where you expect a happy or a conclusive ending. You are just a viewer of the lives of the characters, whose lives continues even after the story ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story could have been much better but there were lot of speed breakers in this journey. I must say that the author adopted a difficult way of writing and tried to give full justice to all characters, but there were some noticeable faults which hindered my reading experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having said that, I feel being a debut author, and trying something like this is tough. I hope and feel that the author will go a long way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/29/Once-Upon-A-Time-by-Saurav-Chhawchharia/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/29/Once-Upon-A-Time-by-Saurav-Chhawchharia/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Island of the Day Before by Zuni Chopra</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can conveniently say that this is one of the best collection of short stories I have ever read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very different perspective of basic things has been put in front. Thoughts which are merely thoughts for us are beautifully expressed through words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t believe things as simple as a tree, clouds or an old woman could be described in such words as done by Zuni Chopra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being just 17 year old, the view that the writer has about the world makes me believe that the world is a piece of art. All it needs is a person with an eye for that art.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zuni Chopra talks about everything - war, old age, ghosts, life, island, sea and what not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though I loved reading each page and every word of the book but my favourite stories are H.A.U.N.T.E.D. and The Little Matchstick Girl. These are kind of stories you would love to read to kids as much as you would love to read it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you are a reader or not, this book is definitely recommended!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>28 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/28/the-island-of-the-day-before-by-zuni-chopra/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/28/the-island-of-the-day-before-by-zuni-chopra/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Imperial Alchemist by A. H. Wang</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;UA legend buried for 2000 years. A woman compelled to uncover the truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;210 BCE, CHINA. The most powerful emperor China has ever known is on the brink of death. In desperation, he sends his most gifted alchemist and sorcerer on a quest for the mythical elixir of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His fleet never returned….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NOW, world-renowned archaeologist Georgia Lee is compelled to hunt for a mysterious man who may hold the secret to the greatest discovery in human history. Her search takes her on a thrilling journey from an ancient tomb in China, through traditional Japan, to the blistering Australian outback, and the dizzying heights of verdant mountains in tropical Taiwan. But what begins as an investigation into an archaeological riddle turns into something very sinister. Georgia starts to suspect that perhaps she is the one being hunted instead….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meticulously researched, this is a tale interwoven with rich historical facts to recreate all the drama, intrigue and mystery of East Asian culture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if someone tells you that there exists elixir somewhere in the world, making the person immortal who drinks it. Would you believe it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Imperial Alchemist takes you on one such adventure trip. Georgia, an archaeologist is assigned the task of finding the elixir by a business tycoon Mr. Lambert. The task is much difficult then it seems and much twisted then you would expect. Georgia who first thinks it is just an unrealistic demand of a copious businessman, soon realises it is well planned conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story takes place in China, Japan and Taiwan. It unfolds beautifully, disclosing right amount of information at right time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is part historical, part mythical, and part legend, and many of its characters are based on actual historical figures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though it contains lot of historical content but it never seems boring. The author has clearly done a detailed research about each and everything related to Qin Dynasty, Hsu Fu and the places where the story takes place. The writing style is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The character development is really interesting. They are very realistic. Every character gets it’s fair share of role in the story. You feel emotionally connected to them even if that character has no present existence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story ends with decent amount of lose ends to be caught up within the sequel. I couldn’t stop myself from finishing the book. Neither did I want it to get over so soon. Desperately waiting for the release of the sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you like to read history, mystery, adventure or thriller then this book is definitely for you. Even if you are not very keen about these genres then this is the book which will make you a fan of these genres. (I am was not a history enthusiast either.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/25/the-imperial-alchemist-by-ah-wang/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/25/the-imperial-alchemist-by-ah-wang/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Unlocked Silences by Mukhpreet Khurana</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlocked Silences is a collection of abstracts, poems and excerpts written on tissue papers over a couple of years. It is a dive deep into the circles of emotion, empathy, acceptance, healing and insights into a different perspective towards life. In the voice of a budding adolescent, the book cascades into day-to day-shortcomings, carved into poetry and at the same time, embraces you in silence and stillness of thought. The book is an attempt to connect with the reader, to reflect upon them, unbiased and together and embrace a new beginning. With simplified use of grammar and vocabulary, this book seeks nothing but the companionship of all. With this debut book, the author aims to connect to one and to all in the message and purpose of existence, the aid of spirituality and an ode to a beautiful journey called life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book is like a friend who you would go to whenever you are anxious, upset, nervous, happy or excited. A friend whom you can listen to for hours, a friend who can listen you for hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a book you can pick after a tiring day, randomly open a page and read it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book isn’t supposed to be rushed through but to be enjoyed one page a time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The poems are simple, relatable and heart touching. It covers topics from our everyday lives. Talking about love, life, hardwork, belief and hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though at some places the lines seemed unrelated and didn’t made much sense to me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as a whole I really loved the book. It is one of those to be preserved and shared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/21/unlocked-silences-by-mukhpreet-khurana/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/21/unlocked-silences-by-mukhpreet-khurana/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Lucky Ones by Ashley Chegwyn</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too much is an overdose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a mandatory six month hiatus, Hollywood’s favourite It-Girl, Emery Grey, finds herself back in the spotlight she’s trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cameras are still flashing, her mother is bribing her and she’s in a PR relationship with the devil. Combine that with the therapy sessions and medication, she’s drowning under the pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucky for her, her behind-closed-doors boyfriend, Colton, is happy to dive in and help. However, Emery doesn’t want him to hang on if it means pulling him under too.

This story has it all. It deals with the reality of the rich class. How important can their status and prestige be to them. And how they can cross any limits just to ensure that they are presenting their images as they want to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ending was so abrupt that I had to turn the pages back and forth to ensure that I didn’t miss anything. It didn’t give any clue for a sequel neither seemed complete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I am glad to know that it will have a sequel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now i am expecting a lot more twists and turns in the next part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>18 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/18/the-lucky-ones-by-ashley-chegwyn/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/18/the-lucky-ones-by-ashley-chegwyn/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This one was my first Agatha Christie read. I have always been excited to read this book and it didn’t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the book has been written almost a century ago, but it is still equally enticing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A train, a murder, a lot of suspects, all having watertight alibis. Then how did the murder take place under the most impossible conditions?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has a strong plot. Although there are a lot of characters, yet each is clearly identifiable. The author has been successful in maintaining suspense till the end. There are a lot of twists which keeps you hooked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style of Agatha Christie is very clever. It makes you feel like a detective and you try to solve the mystery as one. But you can’t beat Hercule Poirot!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you love to read suspense and mystery, then this one is definitely one of the best recommendations for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>12 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/12/murder-on-the-orient-express-by-agatha-christie/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/12/murder-on-the-orient-express-by-agatha-christie/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Secrets by John Callas</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the dark genius of wartime Nazi Germany, a secret strategy for world domination has come to the 21st century. A conspiracy too chilling to be believed . . . until it’s unleashed. The son of a hero who gave his life fighting this evil must now take up his father’s mission, and with his beautiful fellow agent meet the shadowy enemy - in the streets, in the frozen Arctic, and in the emptiness of space itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secrets is an emotional rollercoaster with lots of unpredictable twists. It has everything from love and action to humour and terror. It kept me hooked since the initial pages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It literally takes you to the moon and back. There are lots of characters in the story which confused me at some points. Nonetheless, it is by far one of the best books I have read this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any further description about the greatness of this book will end up in me giving spoilers. (I would never want to spoil any book for the readers.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were some loose ends in the novel making it capable of having a sequel. And the good news is that it is going to have a sequel soon!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>09 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/09/Secrets-by-john-callas/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/09/Secrets-by-john-callas/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Bruised and Broken by Benita A. David</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s Hannah’s second chance at FIRST LOVE. It’s Matthew’s first chance at TRUE LOVE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah has had it rough. Be it her childhood or youth. She fell in love twice. And got her heart broken twice-the second time being the worst. When every last bit of hope was drained, she found herself facing her first love, the guy who hadn’t even really spoken to her and yet managed to disapprove of her love. But when he was extending a hand of care and affection and a possible liking, her past interceded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s an old acquaintance. An acquaintance that developed a crush on him and was eventually turned down by him. 8 years later, here he is staring at her scarred face. She has run away and it was a spur of the moment decision to rescue her and take her to his home. As stupid as anyone would say his decision was, he found it compelling to save her from whatever or whoever she was running from. But who was she running from? And why is he suddenly developing feelings for the one he drove away years back?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s upto Matthew now to find out her fears, mend it and give her new hope. Could he give her a reason to believe again? To love again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story speaks of one of the social issues - domestic violence. As much as we claim gender equality, there are still women undergoing unspeakable torture. This story is about one such woman who could take it no more and has run away. What happens next and how her hopeless life turns around is what this story is about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes beauty lies in the simplest of things and Bruised and Broken is one such simple yet beautiful story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hannah is found by Matthew in a hospital. She is badly bruised and hurt. Matthew wants to help her but is also afraid of the after effects of helping her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the story is quite predictable, I loved the way the author has executed it. We see really strong characters and powerful dialogues. The essence and the emotions of the story have been maintained throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each and every character in the story comes out distinctly and leaves its impact on the readers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are no extravagant romance and action just a simple and a heartfelt story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend it for a light and emotional read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>08 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/08/bruised-and-broken-by-benita-david/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/08/bruised-and-broken-by-benita-david/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Changes by Hansel D.

She’s been spending her free time at the beach with her best friend Tommy, the epitome of “sexy surfer boy,” and at Waves, a local joint that tourists flock to, mostly female and mostly because Tommy runs the bar. But in an effort to please her father and “do something with her education” she takes a job at prestigious Lake Associates as the assistant to Mr. Lake himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though she’s completely out of her element, far from play-dates and Pampers, she’s determined to handle her new position with total professionalism. That is until she meets her boss’ son Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jeremy is terribly good-looking, irresistibly charming, and refreshingly polite. But there are rumors swirling around his recent and mysterious return to the States and the company. No one knows where he’s been, what he’s been doing, or why he suddenly returned. What’s worse is the rumor that he’s been mixing business and pleasure with a handful of female employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite all that, Chris is inexplicably drawn to him. But before she can explore her attraction she has to know the truth, the whole truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The question is can she handle all the secrets the Lakes are keeping?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about a young woman, Chris who works as a full time nanny. But due to her father’s constant nagging she accepts a corporate job offer of secretary in The Lakes Associates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is doing pretty good till Jeremy Lake enters the scene. He is attractive, muscular and very good natured. Chris is attracted to him but doesn’t want to be engaged with a colleague.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was pretty clueless about how the story is going to unfold by the time I had completed 70-80% of the book. The story seemed nice since the beginning. Talking about friendship, love, attraction, hookups, career, etc. But there was nothing exciting in it. The story seemed to be very bland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time I reached to last few chapters, I was pretty sure that there is a twist waiting. And I was right though not on what it might be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The twist is interesting and not at all predictable. The development of characters is quite good and realistic. They have some flaws but they live up with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing style is good, though there are some grammatical errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/the-lakes-by-anna-desourdy/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/the-lakes-by-anna-desourdy/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Is Break Up End of Love? by Sreekara Govinda</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does breakup end the love that is residing deeply inside the heart of a person?

And the writing style seems to follow Chetan Bhagat’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It becomes interesting in the second half. You want to know what happens between this really romantic couple. Though I had imagined few different situations, it turned out to be totally unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good Points 1) Characters are really good. 2) I loved the role of John’s parents. They are friends, guide and mentor to him. 3) The first half of the book can definitely give you some relationship goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bad Points 1) The entire novel just revolves around John’s love interest. 2) Typical “fall in love - have issues - breakup - resolve - patchup” theme is followed 3) There could have been more elements in the story other than love and breakup. 4) There are a lot of grammatical errors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a story that masses could relate to. There are troubles in every relationship. But if you love someone, you trust them. If there is any miscommunication then you need to clear it together instead of just taking decisions and running away from the problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>02 Sep 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/is-break-up-end-of-love-by-sreekara-govinda/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/09/02/is-break-up-end-of-love-by-sreekara-govinda/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Scavenger by J. L. Willow</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;“IT’S NOT SECRETS THAT ARE DANGEROUS. IT’S WHAT SECRETS MAKE PEOPLE DO.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a number of teen drug overdoses disturbs the NYPD, an investigation is quickly formed to uncover the forces behind it. Four people with no previous connection soon find themselves the object of scrutiny as the case moves forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Catherine is a freshman living an unfulfilled high school life. After a gentle nudge from her best friend Eve, she begins searching for more. A boy named Samuel may be the answer to what she’s looking for, but not everything is what it seems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samuel has connections to the investigation in more ways than Catherine realizes and carries more secrets than he cares to admit. His decision to take a risky bet with a man named Frank seems like easy money but instead causes his life to quickly unravel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frank is a drug dealer living in New York City, best known for his heinously addictive strains of laced marijuana. With the NYPD closing in and pressure slowly building, he discovers the life he’s carefully built for himself in danger of collapse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nathan Tawallis of the NYPD is lead investigator of the case. Much as he tries to ignore it, long forgotten memories begin to surface and past connections to the drug network quickly become too hard to ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With lives becoming inexorably entangled, The Scavenger weaves a tale of suspense and finding family in unsuspecting places while simultaneously delving into the dangers and alarming nature of the illegal drug trade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Scavenger is a story about drug addiction and the sufferings due to it, directly or indirectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a very simple story yet something which needs to be talked about with increasing cases of addiction and overdose of drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story has four main characters Catherine, Samuel, Frank and Nathan. They are all somehow involved in drug dealings happening around the town. How is it affecting their lives as well as others. The story doesn’t deal with the fact about who is right and who is wrong. Like in real lives the characters can not be categorised into black and white. They live in the grey in between. The author is trying to convey the situations faced by people involved in drugs through the story. There is everything in this story addiction, death, love, mistakes and redemption. The story makes us realise that everyone does not get a second chance in their life, so make use of the chance you have.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a really good novel written finely and in a precise manner. It is a fast paced story and there is no dragging of plot. The beauty of the book increased when I realised that the author is a seventeen year old girl. The maturity with which Julia Willow has dealt with the theme of the story is commendable. There is a need for this level awareness regarding drugs in the youth. A need to know the difference between right and wrong. A need to know the importance of sharing your problems with your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At some places I felt like there could have been more detailed account of the happenings. Some events occur but cantc leave its impact due to happening of other events. Though it didn’t hold much importance in expression of the main story, it could have given an emotional connectivity and understanding between the character and the reader. The emotional rollercoaster of the story takes slight ups and downs where really steep curves could have occurred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>25 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/25/the-scavenger-by-jl-willow/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/25/the-scavenger-by-jl-willow/</guid> </item> <item> <title>A Murder of Crows by Christopher Hoffman</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1945, at the end of World War 2, Joseph Stalin did not believe that Adolf Hitler would remain in his bunker and take his own life. Figuring the German Fuhrer was too cocky, egotistical, and narcissistic, it must be a rouse giving him time to escape Berlin. With no confirmable facts provided to the public, Stalin unleashes Mikael his “Fixer” to hunt down and kill a list of escaped, high ranking, dangerous Nazis and their leader. After several years and little luck, the trail was getting cold. Mikael makes a bold move and trades in his team of soldiers for a handpicked band of misfits, each with their own specialty along with a need for redemption. Can this rag tag eccentric group do better than the elite forces that were previously sent on this mission? They will need to, if they intend on changing the course of history as we know it. A Murder of Crows was originally written as a pay television series. The long awaited conversion to novel format has finally arrived. Be sure to check out other books in the Fairchild Mystery-Thriller series where the author blends real life facts with his fictional team.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a cleverly written book combining facts with fiction. I liked the concept. Though I am not really a history enthusiast, I did enjoy this story. But I would like to warn the readers of dark and violent content of the story. It contains a lot of scenes of murder and torture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book though written from third person’s perspective very smartly takes up to first person’s perspective while reading through Henry’s journals. The perspective and timezones shifts very neatly from one to another and back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked Abigail and Finn a lot. They are young, smart and wise beyond their years. They solve the mystery started by Abigail’s grandfather and are not scared to follow his footsteps for the sake of justice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lot of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Looks like the book wasn’t edited even once. This make the the story a little dull. Had that thing been taken care of, I would have definitely given it 5⭐&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/21/a-murder-of-crows-by-christopher-hoffman/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/21/a-murder-of-crows-by-christopher-hoffman/</guid> </item> <item> <title>1984 by George Orwell</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year 1984 has come and gone, but George Orwell’s prophetic, nightmarish vision in 1949 of the world we were becoming is timelier than ever. 1984 is still the great modern classic of “negative utopia”—a startlingly original and haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing, from the first sentence to the last four words. No one can deny the novel’s hold on the imaginations of whole generations, or the power of its admonitions—a power that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Government (known as The Party) wants to exercise control over everything. All the houses have telescreens, to keep the people constantly under surveillance . What the people do, speak, read, write, eat, drink or even THINK, It wants to monitor everything. Anything which might breed rebellion is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are influenced to act as eyes and ears of The Party since their early ages. Woman are taught to have sex just to produce offsprings and are not supposed to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Party also makes sure that the minds of people are filled with thoughts that It desires. Thinking about anything else is a thoughtcrime and is punishable. For the same reason The Party has created a new language Newspeak, which focuses on translating all the unnecessary words into easier ones. For example ‘bad’ became ungood hence eliminating the word ‘bad’. It also tries to eliminate words which promotes people to think of any kind of thoughtcrime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to The Party, if it says 2+2=5, then it is. No questions asked, no counter arguments made, no logic required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Party has manipulated the minds of people in such a way that they have stopped being affected by how The Party is constantly updating the history as per its choice. They accept everything as if it was always supposed to be that way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winston does not want to except this. He is a rebel. He realizes the importance of freedom. Rebels are rare but they exist. But rebellion is something not acceptable by The Party. Whoever tries to rebel is tortured till he/she accepts the principles of the party and start loving and respecting it truly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes they threaten you with something - something you can’t stand up to, can’t even think about. And then you say, “Don’t do it to me, do it to somebody else, do it to So-and-so.” … You WANT it to happen to the other person. You don’t give a damn what they suffer. All you care is yourself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the time when The Party can make you do or confess anything it wants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could simply kill the rebels. But hating The Party is a freedom for people which is not bearable by It. So It transforms the rebels. Until they accept that everything that The Party has stated is correct. They generate love for The Party in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end The Party is the only truth. There is nothing after or before It.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel is very thoughtfully written. When we see the media being corrupt and facts being distorted, we acknowledge the importance of truth and freedom. George Orwell shows us our future in a simple yet a heart touching way. And if money and power is started to be used in the way as forecasted by Orwell, it won’t be long enough that it ends the same way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>20 Aug 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/20/1984-by-george-orwell/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/08/20/1984-by-george-orwell/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Waking by Matthew Smith</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isabel Sykes, 23, recounts the recent attempt she made to come to terms with the loss of her mother, the acclaimed but psychologically disturbed novelist Marianne Sykes. Marianne died in an unexplained house fire when Isabel was ten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inspired by the appearance of Imogen Taylor, an enchanting young woman who wants to write a PhD on her mother’s work, Isabel plunges into the depths of her past and an intense new friendship. After discovering that Imogen is not who she seems to be, Isabel must face the darkest moments from her childhood in order to protect her family from more tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She receives unexpected help from beyond the grave: in the strange, glittering fragments of her mother’s last, unfinished work, ‘Midnightsong’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially the story seems to be a bit vague but as the plot unfolds you start to understand things in a better way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a reader you are at the place of Isabel. Reading this novel is like experiencing her journey yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is ambiguous at various points, as there are few questions which were left unanswered for the readers to make their own interpretations. There is lot of reading between the lines. It is a really different from all other thriller or suspense novels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The suicide of Marianne is the central theme of the book but how everyone has been affected by it and what do they know about it varies from person to person. Love, loss, friendships, different personality traits of characters, decisions made in the spur of the moment but regretting later, mental health issues and inability to know everything are somethings which are very natural. Like our lives the story demands acceptance. We need to accept the things as it is, learn from the experiences and move on. And so is the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author has a very beautiful poetic writing style. You can’t have enough of the book. You wish the story to continue even after it is finished.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>11 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/11/the-waking-by-matthew-smith/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/11/the-waking-by-matthew-smith/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Girl With The Green Tinted Hair by Gavin Whyte</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a season for everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Described as, “Moving”, “Uplifting”, and “Enlightening”, The Girl with the Green-Tinted Hair is a spiritual fable about personal growth and about seeing how truly magical life is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a boy finds a girl singing and dancing under his favourite tree he didn’t realise he had been chosen to be the one-off witness to something out of this world. The boy is shown how to live in joy and is reminded of how to pursue his life’s calling. His fear of ageing is overcome and dying is no longer what it seems - all because of the girl with the green-tinted hair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this truly comforting tale of wonder and intrigue, which has been called a “hidden gem”, we discover for ourselves how to live in harmony with that which is forever flowing; that which we call life. (&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Girl With Green Tinted Hair is a beautiful and one of the sweetest story I have ever read. After reading the title I was very much expecting it to be a thriller like Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Girl behind the Glass etc. This is what “The Girl” in the title gives you away with the idea of book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I was surprised to see what the book had in store instead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story isdivided into 4 chapters which are basically the four seasons in an year - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The writer has very cleverly related a tree in every season to the lifecycle of a human. Spring devotes childhood, summer devotes teenage. Autumn has been related to adulthood while winter to old age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story seems like a song, with every word it touches your heart. I couldn’t have enough of the life lessons shared artfully throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend this book to everyone, from all age groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/the-girl-with-the-green-tinted-hair-by-gavin-whyte/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/the-girl-with-the-green-tinted-hair-by-gavin-whyte/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Forever Disguised by Annie Woods</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erica Lindell would give anything to turn back time. To get a second chance to make the right decisions. To undo the devastating mistake that ruined everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Left heartbroken after the loss of the love of her life, Sasha aka Prince Alexandre, Erica has to find a way to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart and live with the consequences of her actions. But finding the strength to go on with her life is not all she has to contend with. Soon, Erica finds herself in the midst of the evil feuding behind the attack on Sasha and she has to fight to protect herself and all that is near and dear to her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amongst all of the confusion, pain and hurt, Tyler proposes a solution that may solve all of her problems. But will Erica go through with Tyler’s crazy scheme?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The much-anticipated second book of the Angelheart Saga Trilogy is another enchanting, heart-wrenching story about the mistakes made in the name of love, full of drama, passion and surprising twists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Continuing from where it left in First Came Forever, once again Annie Woods won my heart with her novel. She has a beautiful writing style.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love the way she developed the characters. I have read several books in which I couldn’t love even a single character. But I must say, in this novel each and every person is lovable. (Though there are a few villians as well, as supposed to be in a good fiction).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shasha is a sweetheart as he is in the first book. Even after all the mishappenings with him, he comes back full of life and love for Erica.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erica develops from a strong girl to a fierce women through her journey. She deals with her loss and tries to live her life just to fulfill her dreams. She is fighter and a true inspiration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various characters I fell in love with apart from Erica and Shasha.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Danny is Erica’s best friend and he has proved it. Though there were some fights and misunderstandings between the two but he stood by her when she needed him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tyler is the characters that I have got a literary crush on. He changes from a cocky and arrogant popular guy of the school to a dedicated lover. Even after knowing that Erica loves Shasha and might never love him the same way, he supports her. He stands by her when no one else even knows the whole truth. He loves her and proves his love for her everytime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miriam, Erica’s best friend from previous school reminds me of my best friend. Who will always question me and make sure I take decisions which I don’t regret later. Who, even though we are not always together will makeup for everything we missed whenever we meet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story had everything from love and action to heartbreaks and suspense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once again the story has some grammatical errors but they can be ignored. The story leaves you at a point where you are waiting for the release of next book desperately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really recommend The Angelheart Saga to those looking for YA Fiction and Romance with some suspense and twists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>06 Jul 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/forever-disguised-by-annie-woods/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/07/06/forever-disguised-by-annie-woods/</guid> </item> <item> <title>First Came Forever by Annie Woods</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backpacking with her high school friends, Erica Lindell’s life takes a thrilling new turn. Meeting the fascinating Sasha Ailes, she can’t help but fall completely and irrevocably in love with him. When he feels the same way about her, Erica finds herself drawn into a fairytale love story that will set her life on a new direction. But Sasha has kept his true identity a secret. Finding out who he really is, Erica must overcome the betrayal and make the hardest choice of her life. Can she give up her own dreams to live in his world, or leave and lose him forever?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First Came Forever is an enchanting, heart-wrenching story about finding true love and the devastating consequences it can lead to. What price is too high to pay, even for love?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I really loved the book except for some typos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The relationship of Erica and Shasha is beautifully described. And not only that, I also loved the way how the LGBTQ has been represented in the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially I didn’t really think that I would enjoy the book because I am not really into romantic or young adult genre. I found it rather slow paced and skipped lot of paragraphs. But to my surprise I was so hooked to it by the end that I couldn’t believe the book was over just yet. It finished on a cliffhanger and now I can’t wait for the release of 2nd part of the series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Well the second book releases on 18th June, 2018.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>03 Jun 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/06/03/First-Came-Forever-by-Annie-Woods/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/06/03/First-Came-Forever-by-Annie-Woods/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Behind Closed Doors by B.

You’d like to get to know Grace better. But it’s difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace’s friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn’t Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;What if a perfect looking marriage is actually a perfect lie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about Jack and Grace who are known as the perfect couple amongst their friends. But what happens behind closed doors is something no one can imagine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack is a brilliant lawyer who defends battered women. He plays a perfect host in social gatherings. He apparenptly loves his wife, Grace and her sister, Millie, who is suffering from downs syndrome&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I love Grace, Millie and Esther. They are smart, intelligent and aware of everything happening around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grace although has lived in a torturous environment for almost an year, has been able to maintain sanity of her mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Millie is wiser than what people think. She knows that her sister, Grace is in a problem and tries to help her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Esther is smart. She doesn’t takes up thing as they are. She have a curious mind and a kind heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jack’s character was a bit bland. Making him villian just for the sake of it. A little more work could be done on developing his character.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However I read this book in a day. It was so engaging that I was hooked to it since the first page. The first time I looked up from the novel, I realised I have already completed 50% of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I read the last chapter thrice in a hope that their would be something more to it. I couldn’t believe that it got over just yet. I wished it could go on for a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is a dark, disturbing novel. And I would definitely recommend it to you if psychological thriller is your genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>29 May 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/05/29/behind-closed-doors-by-ba-paris/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/05/29/behind-closed-doors-by-ba-paris/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Turn of the Screw by Henry James</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;A very young woman’s first job: governess for two weirdly beautiful, strangely distant, oddly silent children, Miles and Flora, at a forlorn estate…An estate haunted by a beckoning evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half-seen figures who glare from dark towers and dusty windows- silent, foul phantoms who, day by day, night by night, come closer, ever closer. With growing horror, the helpless governess realizes the fiendish creatures want the children, seeking to corrupt their bodies, possess their minds, own their souls…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But worse-much worse- the governess discovers that Miles and Flora have no terror of the lurking evil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For they want the walking dead as badly as the dead want them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Turn of the Screw is a story of a governess who is hired by a man who has become responsible for his young nephew and niece after the death of their parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the governess reaches the estate she realises that there is something creepy about the place and the children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some figures glare at her from distant towers and dusty windows and keep coming closer each time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She realises that the ghost doesn’t want her but the children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story contains all the elements of a perfect horror story – spooky house, creepy children, dead figures and undefined relationships between various characters.

Next morning, a police inspector appears, enquiring about a car that hurtled off a bridge nearby. The girl who was in the vehicle is missing. As the eyes of the hotel-dwellers turn to each other, tragedy strikes again, this time much closer. Can Neelabh and Shakshi escape alive from Infinity? They soon learn that the devils inside them are no less dark than the devils outside. When secrets are peeled off like skin, people bleed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This psychological thriller is about a newlywed couple Neelabh and Sakshi who are trying to run away from a crime they did and end up in Hotel Infinity. The hotel houses Mr Saini (the Manager), Firoz (the Housekeeper), Mr Chand (a painter), Mrs Anthony (an old widow) and their deep dark secrets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neelabh and Sakshi had no idea what mess they are landing themselves in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything is fine until an inspector (Mr Hiten) shows up in the hotel to inquire about a car accident which took place on the highway. The girl who was in the car goes missing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the story unfolds everyone’s dirty secrets are exposed one after the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a dark story involving addiction, murders, dead bodies, blood, rape, sexual assault, torture, abduction, organ theft, necrophilia and love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The novel is majorly written from the perspective of Neelabh, Sakshi and Firoz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I got hooked on the novel from the very first page. The story keeps taking unpredictable twists and turns. Each twist made me go ‘shitshitshitno’. The climax was far from what I was expecting. But then the quality of a good thriller is that it is unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautifully written story, with events happening smoothly one after the other. The pace remains perfect, neither too slow so as to bore you nor too fast so as to miss on important parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend this novel to those looking for the psychological thriller genre.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>26 Mar 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/03/26/the-girl-behind-the-glass-by-sumit-pramanik/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/03/26/the-girl-behind-the-glass-by-sumit-pramanik/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Gabriel Born by Muriel Stockdale</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila Jensen, desperate to invent a genetic cure, defies rules against combining animal and human DNA. She stirs outrage, so her fiancE and boss, Philip Ohl, blames her for the illegal and immoral work, destroying her career. Still, Sheila is motivated; her diagnosis will kill her, so she engineers her last ovum to make a deadly nerve disorder cure. Risking her life, she bears the child, hoping her transferable DNA cure will work, but she can’t find the cure in Gabriel’s DNA. She loses faith; soon her strength and health deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Gabriel grows, her perception shifts. He is a prodigy that wins her wounded heart. She is shocked when he develops perfect blue wings at age five. All he wants to do is fly. Sheila can’t contain him. When he flies, some of each watcher’s consciousness joins him; his audience feels as if they fly too. When video goes viral, devotees flock to watch the angel boy, hoping to join the ecstatic ride. Violent protestors arrive too, spewing vitriol against him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sheila flees with Gabriel, afraid that Philip will claim her son. When he does so with a court order that shuts Sheila out, she fears for Gabriel. She knows the institution will do anything in the name of research. Gabriel has completely opened her heart, healed her, and given her a taste of unimagined freedom. Clearly, the only way to rescue him is to accept his expanded vision and allow him to teach her how to actually fly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is about the mother and son relationship. The mother who tries every possible thing to save his son from getting unwanted attention and the son who’s only wish is to heal his mother and give her a taste of unimagined freedom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story is really interesting and kept me hooked from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>21 Feb 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/02/21/gabriel-born-by-muriel-stockdale/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/02/21/gabriel-born-by-muriel-stockdale/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Hundred Year Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all starts on the one-hundredth birthday of Allan Karlsson. Sitting quietly in his room in an old people’s home, he is waiting for the party he-never-wanted-anyway to begin. The Mayor is going to be there. The press is going to be there. But, as it turns out, Allan is not… Slowly but surely Allan climbs out of his bedroom window, into the flowerbed (in his slippers) and makes his getaway. And so begins his picaresque and unlikely journey involving criminals, several murders, a suitcase full of cash, and incompetent police. As his escapades unfold, we learn something of Allan’s earlier life in which – remarkably – he helped to make the atom bomb, became friends with American presidents, Russian tyrants, and Chinese leaders, and was a participant behind the scenes in many key events of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This story as evident from the title is about a hundred-year-old man, Allan Karlson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allan Karlson lives in an Old Age Home. He decides run away from that place on his 100th birthday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The story opens in two folds. Firstly in the present, which describes his days after leaving the old age home. The author simultaneously tells us about his past. His entire journey and how he ends up in the Old Age Home. I found the theme of the story very exciting. Events occurring one after the other with new names coming in the picture with almost every chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The flashback part was filled with lots of facts and names of people and places making it difficult to read. But I read it anyways, skipping pages over pages. By the time I reached the end, I realised that there was no link of the past with present until last few chapters (which can also be read without actually knowing the background). It felt like wasting a lot of time in the information which was not really relevant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are reading this book and are not interested in knowing the ‘extra facts’ just like me, you can skip the chapters dated before 2005. I hope this suggestion helps and make your reading more pleasurable for this book.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>24 Jan 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/24/the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared-by-jonas-jonasson/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/24/the-hundred-year-old-man-who-climbed-out-of-the-window-and-disappeared-by-jonas-jonasson/</guid> </item> <item> <title>The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint Exupéry</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moral allegory and spiritual autobiography, The Little Prince is the most translated book in the French language. With a timeless charm it tells the story of a little boy who leaves the safety of his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the vagaries of adult behaviour through a series of extraordinary encounters. His personal odyssey culminates in a voyage to Earth and further adventures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This novel is not really a children’s storybook as the cover may reflect. It is better understood and appreciated by older readers. Although it is not inappropriate for children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The narrator’s plane accidentally lands in a desert. There he meets The Little Prince. This prince has come from another planet (or you can say an asteroid).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Prince is travelling from planet to planet (asteroid to asteroid) to gain knowledge and ends up reaching Earth because he has been told, “It has a good reputation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their conversation reveals how a child is always inquisitive about everything. It tells us about the human psychology. Human tends to become a more complex character as they grow up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things that we start to accept as it is, as we grow up. We stop questioning. We assume that there is nothing to learn. But it is not true. Sometimes some questions asked by kids make us ponder about it. But as grown-ups, we ignore their questions and hence their curiosity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author supports his thinking with some beautiful quotes. These words will make you believe in what the author has to convey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;GROWN-UPS LOVE FIGURES… WHEN YOU TELL THEM YOU’VE MADE A NEW FRIEND THEY NEVER ASK YOU “WHAT DOES HIS VOICE SOUND LIKE? WHAT GAMES DOES HE LOVE BEST? DOES HE COLLECT BUTTERFLIES? ” INSTEAD THEY DEMAND “HOW OLD IS HE? HOW MUCH DOES HE WEIGH? HOW MUCH MONEY DOES HIS FATHER MAKE? ” ONLY FROM THESE FIGURES DO THEY THINK THEY HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;―Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The author mocks the adult for being interested in quantitative details only. They would not believe something until some figures are attached to it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,” they would not be able to get an idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: “I saw a house that cost $20,000.” Then they would exclaim: “Oh, what a pretty house that is!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;IT IS THE TIME YOU HAVE WASTED FOR YOUR ROSE THAT MAKES YOUR ROSE SO IMPORTANT.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;―Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the time that you spend on a thing/ person/ task which makes it important for you. You don’t want to let it go away from your life. A huge rose garden is not as meaningful as the rose you took care of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This simple yet adorable novel is one which will leave its mark on you forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jan 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/the-little-prince-by-antoine-de-saint-exup%C3%A9ry/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/the-little-prince-by-antoine-de-saint-exup%C3%A9ry/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Room by Emma Donoghue</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;To five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Told in the inventive, funny, and poignant voice of Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience—and a powerful story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world. It is where he was born and grew up; it’s where he lives with his Ma as they learn and read and eat and sleep and play. At night, his Ma shuts him safely in the wardrobe, where he is meant to be asleep when Old Nick visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Room is home to Jack, but to Ma, it is the prison where Old Nick has held her captive for seven years. Through determination, ingenuity, and fierce motherly love, Ma has created a life for Jack. But she knows it’s not enough … not for her or for him. She devises a bold escape plan, one that relies on her young son’s bravery and a lot of luck. What she does not realize is just how unprepared she is for the plan to actually work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Told entirely in the language of the energetic, pragmatic five-year-old Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience and the limitless bond between parent and child, a brilliantly executed novel about what it means to journey from one world to another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Room is a story about the life of a 5-year-old protagonist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The protagonist (Jack) and his Ma live in a room where they have no access to the outside world except a television.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is an innocent and touching story about the two, their escape plans and life outside the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are various instances where the author has successfully maintained the innocence in the character of Jack… Describing Sun as ‘yellow face of God‘. Writing ‘Ma’s other name’ instead of actually writing the other name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautiful story and a definitely recommended for those who are looking for a simple read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-reading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Reading!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; </description> <pubDate>04 Jan 2018</pubDate> <link>https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/room-by-emma-donoghue/</link> <guid isPermaLink="true">https://epeolatry.in/2018/01/04/room-by-emma-donoghue/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Who Moved My Cheese By Spencer Johnson</title> <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;blurb&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blurb:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Who Moved My Cheese? is a simple parable that reveals profound truths. It is an amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a “Maze” and look for “Cheese” to nourish them and make them happy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two are mice named Sniff and Scurry. And two are “Littlepeople”—beings the size of mice who look and act a lot like people. Their names are Hem and Haw.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cheese” is a metaphor for what you want to have in life—whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money, a possession, health, or spiritual peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the “Maze” is where you look for what you want—the organization you work in, or the family or community you live in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change. Eventually, one of them deals with it successfully, and writes what he has learned from his experience on the Maze walls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you come to see “The Handwriting on the Wall,” you can discover for yourself how to deal with change, so that you can enjoy less stress and more success (however you define it) in your work and in your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written for all ages, the story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;my-review&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Review:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? is a story which tells us the importance of adapting to unexpected changes. Highly recommended in the corporate world by managers, this 90 pages short book can be read, enjoyed and understood by everyone – young or old.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a beautiful parable which teaches us a complicated lesson of life in the simplest way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It reminds us that we should not stop moving. We must always keep pushing, trying new things, and be ready to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the OLD, but on building the NEW.” – Socrates&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So decide which character you are.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sniff: One who sniffs all the opportunities and threats as they are approaching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scurry: One who scurries into action or take action immediately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Haw: One who is reluctant to change at first but after seeing no other better alternative decides to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hem: One who is scared of changes and thinks something wrong might happen, hence, doesn’t change at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 id=&quot;some-beautiful-statements-from-the-book&quot;&gt;Some beautiful statements from the book:&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Change Happens.

style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Megha-Bhauka&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; My journey of editing my book with Falguni was amazing. She has good vision and prepares a step-by-step plan with predetermined milestones while working. She took time with my work and didn't rush things and was still able to deliver the work on time. I hope we will have more opportunities to work together in near future. ***- Megha Bhauka (Author of The Mystery Within Us)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Ashwini-Malhotra.jpeg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Ashwini-Malhotra&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; I have found Falguni very professional and committed to her work. I was impressed with her speed and good grasp to complex subject as “Kala Ghoda: The Game of Power”. She not only understood the characters and plot quickly but suggested few improvements and changes to improve the narration. I will surely recommend her to any of my fellow authors and would look forward to collaborating with her in future too. ***- Ashwini Malhotra (Author of Kala Ghoda Series)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Deanna-Washington.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;Deanna-Washington&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Falguni was a delight to work with. I appreciated her command of the English language, her timeliness was incredible, and when I asked for her thoughts and opinions, her input was innovative and relevant.&quot; ***- Deanna Washington (Author of Disneyland Wisdom)*** ___ &quot;My heartfelt appreciation goes to the editor-cum-proof-reader of 'Modern Ved', Falguni Jain. If you find this book a piece of fine literature, credit goes to her. I appreciate her calmness throughout this manuscript.&quot; ***- Amar (Author of Modern Ved)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Harshwardhan-Patil.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;harshwardhan-patil&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;'The beautiful Sky' as a novel means a lot to me, just like every other author. Each one thinks that it is a special and unique one, but while going through the continuous and long routine you skip out the minor details or the mistakes, for that its very important for a professional reviewer. I came across such a very talented person, Falguni Jain (@Bookworm_falguni). She is perfect in her work, and her every fifty-page review through the mail was very awesome. The best part the reviews are very honest, whether the author likes it or not, and that's what real professionalism is. I will recommend the same to the other authors/screenwriters in my friend's circle. Thanks for such a wonderful collaboration. Excited soon to work on the next project.&quot; ***- Harshwardhan Patil (Author of The Beautiful Sky)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/Suka-Anne.JPG?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;suka-anne&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;I am so happy with Falguni’s services! Not only is she a wonderful, kind, respectful person but she is professional, prompt, and constructive with her feedback. I will definitely be keeping her in mind for all of my future projects!&quot; ***- Suka Anne (Author of Brushwork)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/nidhi-kukreja.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;nidhi-kukreja&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Falguni is a wonderful person. She is a great supporter. She does her work precisely. She helped me spot the errors when I couldn't see them because of continuously editing the same again and again. A writer can't find mistakes on his own, that's why they need editor so they can polish the work by eliminating errors. Falguni helped me. She told me to make corrections which were left unseen. She did her work honestly. And I am proud of it. I recommend her to my friends and even on the platform where she can get recognition for her honest work.  I am glad we are connected ❣️&quot; ***- Nidhi Kukreja (Author of The Anonymous)*** ___ &quot;Falguni was one of the beta readers for my book and she was very professional at all times. She was great at finding details in the book that needed some more of my attention and always very helpful with questions I had. It was very easy to collaborate with Falguni because she always responded to emails and messages in a timely maner, she also read the book quickly and had comments along the way. I would recommend using her if you are in need for a beta reader.&quot; ***- Karin Dahan (Author of Survive For Me)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/jesse-morgan.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;jesse-morgan&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;I recently had Falguni Jain beta read for my book, and found her to be very friendly, respectful and finished my book in a timely manner. Her assessment was fair, refreshing and detailed. The aspects she pointed out and addressed were unique to her own experience and comprehension. I certainly feel I gained some perspective and help towards my final product by employing her services. I would recommend Falguni for anyone needing a Beta Reader and an excellent source of outside perspective and feedback.&quot; ***- Jesse Morgan (aka BlackMetalRebellion) (Author of Emerald Spade)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/debjeet-mukherjee.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;debjeeet-mukherjee&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Proofreading seems so effortless with Falguni Jain! Praiseworthy editing skills coupled with timely delivery builds trust for the work she does best!&quot; ***- Debjeet Mukherjee (Author of Voyages Volume I)*** ___ &lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/epeolatry/epeolatory_in/blob/master/images/pages/pj-berman.jpg?raw=true&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot; alt=&quot;P.J. Berman&quot; width=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt; &quot;Falguni’s developmental editing work is fantastic. She is very talented, and is always enthusiastic to discuss ideas.&quot; ***- P. J.
