### **Blurb:**
**Book 1: GATHERING**
Join the group of men with cancer, struggling with identity and overcoming daily life challenges. About friendship, dreams, feelings, ... Told with great depth and subtle humor.

Blurb: A novel about a group of men, who share the trait of all having cancer and living close to Aarhus, Denmark's second-largest city.
The bulk of the pages are quick reads in which we accompany a bunch of middle-aged men and a few women (in the background) as they push tires, daydream about vintage vehicles, and contemplate life.
My goal has been to immerse the reader in a male universe that, in its slightly satirical form, illustrates the relationship between surface and depth, in addition to delivering a compelling tale. Integrity of a man without coming out as overly striving!
Søren Kirkegaard, a philosopher, once said that we all suffer from a disease until death. People who experience cancer in their middle years serve as a constant reminder of our unavoidable demise. The novel's most intricately written sections center on the ideas and acts it provokes.

**Book 2: DRIFTING**
Second book in the trilogy about the network of men with cancer, helping each other in big and small ways. High tension, deep emotions and subtle humor. 

Blurb:The community of men affected by cancer is growing in quantity and quality. But the effort to help those with the worst prospects for recovery puts the network on a collision course with the law.
Monty and the Marchand are presented with a hefty bite of an ancient sea urchin on the island of Samsø. When needs conflict, who should step in to aid when the skeletons fall out of the closet?
In the Café, Johnny expresses his love for Cissy after gaining confidence in himself. Although everything appears hopeful, Johnny still has some unsavory aspects to deal with.
The amount of hemp produced is increasing to the point that it is harder to hide from the authorities. After the FBI get involved, the otherwise benign and pleasant tale turns into a legitimate crime in the second part.

**Book 3: OVERCOMING** 
Inside / Outside perspectives. For reflection and very entertaining. 

Blurb: In this last half of the trilogy of novels about the team, Jobs begins on the bench. For him, freedom has been reduced to a cell and a forced place in a community with criminal gangs. What he thought was going to be an alternative to a study stay develops into a serious crisis.
Kim shocks everyone by popping out as an adventurer. He travels to South America and helps his new friend, Carlos, find his biological family.
Johnny struggles to have a good relationship with his children. He's back on the job and suddenly comes face to face with an old flame. She gets to fan the flames and kindle a new hope.
Monty and the Merchant come on an unexpected assignment in Italy. Hardly are they back home before Cupid shoots his arrows with the Merchant as his chosen victim.
The Imam is getting ready for his final and inevitable journey. He gets help with the preparations from a close friend.

### **My Review:**
Henrik Kruse’s “Men with Cancer” trilogy — “Gathering”, “Drifting”, and “Overcoming”—is a remarkable exploration of life, friendship, and mortality, told through the lens of a group of men connected by their shared experience of living with cancer. 

The first book, “Gathering”, sets the tone for the series, introducing readers to a diverse group of middle-aged men who bond over their shared struggles. Kruse’s writing is rich with subtle humor and philosophical musings, drawing on the ideas of Søren Kirkegaard to explore the tension between surface appearances and deeper truths. The characters are vividly drawn, each dealing with their illness in unique ways. The emotional depth and authenticity of the characters make “Gathering” a powerful start to the trilogy.

“Drifting” shifts gears, introducing higher stakes and a more complex narrative. The community of men grows, and so do the challenges they face, both legally and emotionally. The inclusion of crime elements, such as the production of hemp and the involvement of the FBI, adds an unexpected layer of tension to the story. 

The trilogy culminates in “Overcoming”, where the men confront their most significant challenges yet. The novel broadens its scope as the characters seek freedom, redemption, and meaning in their final days. The global settings and diverse storylines showcase Kruse’s ability to blend personal drama with broader themes. 

Overall, Henrik Kruse’s trilogy is a deeply moving and thought-provoking journey through the lives of men facing their mortality. Another thing I love about these books is that even though it is a story focused on men, it doesn’t take away from the individuality and personality of women present in the story.

While the pacing and editing could have been tighter, the series stands out for its rich character development, emotional depth, and subtle humor. It’s a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of friendship in the face of life’s greatest challenges. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
