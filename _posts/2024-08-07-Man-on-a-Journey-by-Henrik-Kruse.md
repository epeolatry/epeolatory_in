### **Blurb:**
About identity, anxiety and hope, big moments, thoughts at the end of life, everyday life and dreams.

Ten psychotherapeutic tales of men with cancer in their lives finding their way through the crisis, but the struggle is far from ended.

The men dispel the worst stereotypes about how poorly men handle personal problems, each in their own unique way. Numerous subjects are covered, including women, fishing, dream interpretation, anxiety, hope, values, and ethics. A background music with continuous meditations on male identity plays throughout.

The tone is good-natured, humorous and a little self-deprecating. With that in mind, the book can be experienced as an unpretentious tribute to the masculine complexity, to the colors and nuances that appear when the lacquer is scratched.

### **My Review:**
"Man on a Journey" is a refreshing and deeply engaging collection that delves into the complex emotional landscape of men grappling with cancer. The book presents ten psychotherapeutic tales, each exploring the journeys of men as they navigate the trials brought on by their or their loved ones' cancer diagnoses.

From the outset, the book challenges the common stereotypes about men and their emotional resilience. It introduces us to a diverse array of characters, through whom the author explores the notion that men are incapable of dealing with personal crises. Each man’s story is a testament to their strength, vulnerability, and capacity for introspection.

The book stands out for its unflinching honesty. It explores a wide range of subjects—from women and parenting to dream interpretation and ethical dilemmas. One of the book’s most commendable aspects is its focus on genuine emotions and fears. Unlike many male-centric books that often revolve around themes of sexual conquest or revenge, "Man on a Journey" delves into real, raw emotions. It discusses dreams, anxiety, hope, and values, highlighting how these elements evolve amidst personal and familial struggles. The tales shed light on how external and internal factors influence men’s identities and their ways of coping with crises.

The narrative is a powerful reminder of the importance of acknowledging and embracing one’s emotions. It prompts readers to reflect on their own feelings, thoughts, and dreams, offering a therapeutic experience that is both enlightening and comforting. 

The writing style is simple and engaging. The transitions between the past and present, and between the author’s personal and professional life, are executed seamlessly, enhancing the overall reading experience. 

However, the book is not without its flaws. While the writing style is engaging, the editing and formatting could have been more polished. Some passages feel a bit rough around the edges, which slightly detracts from the overall impact. Also, since the book is from the psychologist’s point of view, we don’t always get to see how the characters grow over time. Our knowledge of their development is restricted to their interaction with the author. I would have loved to get an insight into what happens next. However, despite this, the book’s message remains clear and compelling.

"Man on a Journey" is a heartfelt tribute to masculine complexity. It scratches beneath the surface, revealing the nuanced and colorful layers of male identity. This book is a must-read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of men’s emotional lives and the unique ways they cope with life's challenges.
