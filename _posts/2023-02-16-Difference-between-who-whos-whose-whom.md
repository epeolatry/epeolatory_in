If you’ve ever found yourself stuck between the different uses of who’s, whose, who, and whom, you’re not alone. English grammar can be a tricky thing, and these four words are often confusing when it comes to choosing the right one. Let’s break down the differences between these words and explain when to use each one.

Who is a subject pronoun used when asking a question. For example, you would say, “Who ate the last cookie?” or “Who is coming to the movie?”

Who’s is a contraction of the words “who is” or “who has.” For example, you would say, “Who’s coming to the party?” or “Who’s been to the store?”

Whose is a possessive pronoun used to describe something that belongs to someone. For example, you would say, “Whose shoes are these?” or “Whose wallet is this?”

Finally, whom is an object pronoun used in questions. For example, you would say, “To whom did you give the book?” or “Whom did you call?”

By understanding the differences between who’s, whose, who, and whom, you can now easily choose the right word for the right occasion. Now that you know the difference between these four words, you can confidently use them in your written and spoken English.
