### **Blurb:**

Erica Lindell would give anything to turn back time. To get a second chance to make the right decisions. To undo the devastating mistake that ruined everything.

Left heartbroken after the loss of the love of her life, Sasha aka Prince Alexandre, Erica has to find a way to pick up the pieces of her shattered heart and live with the consequences of her actions. But finding the strength to go on with her life is not all she has to contend with. Soon, Erica finds herself in the midst of the evil feuding behind the attack on Sasha and she has to fight to protect herself and all that is near and dear to her.

Amongst all of the confusion, pain and hurt, Tyler proposes a solution that may solve all of her problems. But will Erica go through with Tyler's crazy scheme?

The much-anticipated second book of the Angelheart Saga Trilogy is another enchanting, heart-wrenching story about the mistakes made in the name of love, full of drama, passion and surprising twists.

### **My Review:**

Continuing from where it left in First Came Forever, once again Annie Woods won my heart with her novel. She has a beautiful writing style. 

I love the way she developed the characters. I have read several books in which I couldn't love even a single character. But I must say, in this novel each and every person is lovable. (Though there are a few villians as well, as supposed to be in a good fiction).

Shasha is a sweetheart as he is in the first book. Even after all the mishappenings with him, he comes back full of life and love for Erica.

Erica develops from a strong girl to a fierce women through her journey. She deals with her loss and tries to live her life just to fulfill her dreams. She is fighter and a true inspiration.

There are various characters I fell  in love with apart from Erica and Shasha. 

Danny is Erica's best friend and he has proved it. Though there were some fights and misunderstandings between the two but he stood by her when she needed him.

Tyler is the characters that I have got a literary crush on. He changes from a cocky and arrogant popular guy of the school to a dedicated lover. Even after knowing that Erica loves Shasha and might never love him the same way, he supports her. He stands by her when no one else even knows the whole truth. He loves her and proves his love for her everytime. 

Miriam, Erica's best friend from previous school reminds me of my best friend. Who will always question me and make sure I take decisions which I don't regret later. Who, even though we are not always together will makeup for everything we missed whenever we meet.

The story had everything from love and action to heartbreaks and suspense.

Once again the story has some grammatical errors but they can be ignored. The story leaves you at a point where you are waiting for the release of next book desperately.

I really recommend The Angelheart Saga to those looking for YA Fiction and Romance with some suspense and twists.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
