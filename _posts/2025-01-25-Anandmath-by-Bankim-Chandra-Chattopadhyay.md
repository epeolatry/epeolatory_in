### **Blurb:**
“Anandamath” is an extraordinary political novel. The plot with its epic dimensions is based on the Sanyasi Rebellion in the late eighteenth century. Against all odds the Sanyasis fought the British whom they regarded as an arch enemy of the country and responsible for the terrible famine of 1772.

In this novel Bankim also wrote — Bande Mataram — Hail Motherland — and gave India its first national song which later became a rallying call of the national freedom movement.
“Anandmath” established Bankim Chandra’s skill as a novelist and was a piece of historical fiction imbued with the spirit of nationalism and selfless patriotism. It gave tremendous impetus to the various religious, patriotic and national activities beginning with Hindu missionary activity and culminating in the militant movement in Bengal in the first decade of the twentieth century.

### **My Review:**
“Anandmath” is the book where Bankim Chandra Chatopadhyay first introduces the Vande Matram Song —a song that stirred patriotic hearts for decades. That alone made it worth picking up!

The novel revolves around two big themes: choosing between love for one’s family and love for the country, and the rising Hindu-Muslim tensions. While the story can feel anti-Muslim, it’s essential to consider the historical context. The British, though invaders, cleverly maintained a facade of being righteous while worsening Hindu-Muslim relations through their divide-and-rule policies. Add to that the Bengal famine, and you have a backdrop of immense struggle and conflict.

The author does a great job capturing the hardships of the time—whether it’s the scarcity of resources, women’s safety, or the unifying spirit of a common cause. That said, the nationalism factor lacked depth. The strong female characters are a nice touch, but you can’t help noticing the classic “men writing women” problem here, even back then.

Overall, “Anandamath” is an engaging read. It’s less about igniting patriotism and more about showcasing the power of community and resilience during tough times. A classic with some flaws, but definitely worth your time for its historical and cultural significance.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
