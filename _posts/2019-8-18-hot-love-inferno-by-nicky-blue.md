### **Blurb:**
A half-woman, half-cockroach fused in a bizarre gardening accident? That would be Mrs Jittery Twitch, dwelling in the shadows of our misdeeds. If in danger, you can call upon her help… all she asks is your soul as payment. But she’s just a legend, so no need to worry.

Barry Harris is a 28-year-old man, still living with his dear old mum in a little flat above a hairdresser. His obsession with Star Trek and the martial arts won’t help him when he’s forced out on a date.
And nobody knows about the weird string of events that’s about to put everyone’s lives in danger. A trio of samurai warriors and the strangest offer of help lead Barry on a perilous mission to save the day.

(This book is the second in the Prophecy Allocation series but works fine as a standalone read.)

*Why you should read this book:*

- It explains revolutionary insights into the nature of reality that debunk the myth of free will (probably).
- It proves the multiverse has only two parallel universes (depending on your criteria for what makes up proof).
- It contains 50% extra innuendo-based gags than Book One in the series. Some of them might be considered funny (again this is relative).
- The author achieved a heightened dynamic tension not found in other books. He was heavily constipated during its creation. There may be a link. The author is no way suggesting that this makes it better than every other book ever written. 

***Warning:*** The book is written in British English. All British slang terms are helpfully translated for the international reader, along with a short explanation of why British people are a little strange. 

### **My Review:**

Hot Love Inferno is the second book in Prophecy Allocation series. Though it can also be read as a standalone.

The book is a really interesting combination of science fiction, action, and dark comedy. It is full of quirky one liners which makes the read entertaining.

As I started the book, it was difficult to identify the characters, maybe because I haven’t read the part 1. But gradually I was able to connect to the characters and the story.

Best part of the book is footnotes provided by author. It is funny and works as a bonus material at the end of each chapter.
It is a fast paced story. Scenes take place one after other making some scenes a bit unclear. Some scenes and characters like Bertie Backwards and the Oracle seem out of place and are not really required in  the story. 

I would recommend this book if you like dark humour with a touch of science fiction.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
