### **Blurb:**

Somehow, at the ripe age of twenty-three, I find myself in line to marry a man I don’t love. 

I grind my teeth right there at the dinner table as my mother and father go on and on about how proud they are of me, how proud they are that I, Fallon Addington, will no longer be the black sheep of the family and become the daughter they’ve always wanted. 

Marry Derek and they’ll finally accept me. 
Marry Derek and they’ll stop shoving men from their “social circle” in my direction. 
Marry Derek and become the spitting image of my mother; the perfect corporate wife with a face full of make-up and not a hair out of line. 
Marry Derek and all the shame and guilt will disappear.

But then… I embarrassingly flash Emmett Lanning my bra and suddenly my parents’ hopes and dreams are burning up in flames, right there along with my heart.

### **My Review:**

It is the second novel in the Oak Hill Series, but can be read as a standalone.

The story is about Fallon, a girl from super rich family, who falls in love with a guy from Oak Hill, Emmett, who is the brother of Dawson (protagonist from book 1 of the series). Hence new characters are introduced in the second installment of the series while keeping the characters from 1st book intact.
But this doesn't require the reader to go through the 1st book before reading the 2nd one.

Though the story was predictable, the writing style was brilliant. I really enjoyed reading the story. The emotions that came with the book were raw and real. 

I really enjoyed how the honestly the dillemas of Fallon were shown throughout the story. 

The book takes the reader on a journey of a forced arranged marriage, family drama, friend turned lover, all whilst trying to learn to choose oneself before others. Making yourself the priority is not selfish, it is healing.

The book was a fun read. Though slow initially the author was able to keep the reader hooked with quirky characters and captivating dialogues.

Definitely recommended if you are looking for a light romantic comedy or a rich girl and not so rich guy kind of story.

Happy Reading!!
