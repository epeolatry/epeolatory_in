When it comes to writing fiction, the balance between showing and telling is crucial. Showing refers to the use of vivid and specific sensory details to allow the reader to experience the story as if they were there, while telling is the use of exposition or summary to convey information to the reader. In order to create a well-crafted piece of fiction, writers need to learn how to balance showing and telling. Here are five ways to improve the showing and telling in your fiction.

1.	Use dialogue to show character relationships and emotions. 
Dialogue can be a powerful tool for showing character relationships and emotions. Instead of telling the reader that two characters are in love, show it through their interactions and dialogue. Let the reader hear the tone of their voices and the words they choose. This will allow the reader to experience the emotion for themselves.

2.	Use sensory details to show the setting and mood. 
Sensory details are a great way to immerse the reader in the setting and mood of the story. Rather than telling the reader that it's a dark and stormy night, show them the sound of the rain on the roof, the smell of wet earth, and the feel of the cold wind on their skin. This will create a more vivid and immersive reading experience.

3.	Use action to show character traits. 
Action can reveal a lot about a character's personality and traits. Instead of telling the reader that a character is brave, show them acting courageously. Show the character making difficult decisions, taking risks, and facing their fears. This will make the character more relatable and memorable.

4.	Use internal thoughts to show character motivation. 
Internal thoughts are a great way to show a character's motivations and inner struggles. Instead of telling the reader that a character wants to succeed, show them the character's internal monologue as they push themselves to achieve their goals. This will create a deeper connection between the reader and the character.

5.	Use a narrative summary to tell the backstory. 
While showing is often more effective than telling, there are times when a narrative summary is necessary. Backstory, for example, is often best told through a summary. Rather than showing a character's entire life story, summarize the important details and let the reader fill in the gaps with their imagination.

In conclusion, balancing showing and telling is a key component of effective fiction writing. By using dialogue, sensory details, action, internal thoughts, and narrative summary, writers can create a rich and immersive reading experience for their audience.
