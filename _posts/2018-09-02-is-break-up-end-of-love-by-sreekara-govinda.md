End of Love??? is an emotional rollercoaster which shows various phases of love and describes feelings of a person in every stage "

### **My Review:**
It is a story about John who finds his love, Priya in his college. But what leads to their breakup? And what happens after that?

Well the story line is quite predictable. And the writing style seems to follow Chetan Bhagat's. 

It becomes interesting in the second half. You want to know what happens between this really romantic couple. Though I had imagined few different situations, it turned out to be totally unimaginable.

Good Points
1) Characters are really good.
2) I loved the role of John's parents. They are friends, guide and mentor to him.
3) The first half of the book can definitely give you some relationship goals.

Bad Points
1) The entire novel just revolves around John's love interest.
2) Typical "fall in love - have issues - breakup - resolve - patchup" theme is followed
3) There could have been more elements in the story other than love and breakup.
4) There are a lot of grammatical errors.

It is a story that masses could relate to. There are troubles in every relationship. But if you love someone, you trust them. If there is any miscommunication then you need to clear it together instead of just taking decisions and running away from the problems.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
