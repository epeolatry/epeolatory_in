### **My Review:**
"Street Smart: The Art of Staying Chill in Tough Situations" dives deep into the pressing issue of knife crime in the UK, particularly in London, offering practical guidance to navigate dangerous situations. However, such crimes are a global issue, making the book relevant all around the world.

The book's core message is that through proactive strategies, individuals can sidestep tough situations (not just knife crime) and take control of their lives. It emphasizes the importance of making informed choices, building confidence, working on oneself, and resisting negative influences.

Riaz and Rakeem Akhtar's writing style is refreshingly straightforward and relatable, perfectly suited to connect with young readers. They cut through the noise with a no-BS approach, delivering valuable insights in just 32 pages.

The book provides essential tools for personal safety and empowerment. With 50 invaluable preventative measures and practical tips, quizzes, and real-life scenarios, this book is a game-changer. However, I felt that additional guidance on how to respond when stuck in a knife crime situation would have been even more helpful. 

Nonetheless, it remains a must-read for young individuals navigating urban environments and concerned parents seeking to equip their children with crucial life skills.
