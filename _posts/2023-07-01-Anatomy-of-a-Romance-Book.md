In this blog post, we will explore the anatomy of a romance book using a plot map that reveals the key milestones and twists that make these stories so compelling.

1. Protagonist's Introduction and a Meet-Cute (30%):
Every romantic tale begins by introducing the main character, their aspirations, and the void they seek to fill in their lives. In this initial phase, readers are drawn into the protagonist's world, gaining insight into their hopes, dreams, and the circumstances that shape their journey. Along the way, the protagonist encounters a meet-cute—an unexpected, charming, or humorous first encounter with the love interest. This delightful moment sparks the initial connection between the two, setting the stage for a blossoming romance.

2. Meet-Cute Turning into Serious Love, Reaching Its Almost Peak (15%):
As the story progresses, the initial attraction between the protagonist and the love interest deepens, evolving into a more profound connection.

Their shared experiences, vulnerable moments, and intimate conversations bring them closer, culminating in a peak where their love almost reaches its zenith. The reader becomes invested in their relationship, eagerly rooting for their happiness.

3. The Love Interest's Departure, Threat, or Miscommunication (5%):
To add a layer of tension and conflict, the plot takes an unexpected turn. The love interest, due to various circumstances, may have to leave, face a threat, or be caught up in a miscommunication. This separation or obstacle creates a rift between the protagonist and the love interest, leaving the reader anxious about the future of their relationship.

4. Moving On from the Love Interest (10%):
Unable to be with their initial love interest, the protagonist embarks on a journey of self-discovery and healing. They attempt to fill the void left by their previous love, exploring new possibilities and relationships. This phase showcases the protagonist's growth, resilience, and ability to find happiness even in the face of heartbreak.

5. New Love Interest Reaching Its Peak (20%):
Just when the protagonist starts to move on, a new love interest enters their life. This individual brings excitement, intrigue, and a fresh perspective. The relationship flourishes, building on the lessons learned from the previous love. As their connection deepens, the new love interest reaches its peak, promising a potential happy ending.

6. The Return of the Old Love Interest (5%):
Just when the protagonist has seemingly moved on, fate intervenes, and the old love interest reappears. This unexpected reunion rekindles buried emotions and raises questions about the unfinished business between them. The reappearance of the old love interest injects a sense of conflict and forces the protagonist to confront their unresolved feelings.

7. Missteps of the New Love Interest (5%):
Amidst the chaos caused by the return of the old love interest, the new love interest makes a crucial mistake or faces a personal challenge that jeopardizes their relationship with the protagonist. This twist throws the protagonist into a state of confusion and heartache, questioning whether they made the right choice in moving on.

8. Resolution of the Actual Problem with the Old Love Interest (7.5%):
The core conflict between the protagonist and the old love interest finally comes to light. Whether it's a misunderstanding, unresolved issues, or a clash of circumstances, the plot delves into the resolution of the actual problem that has been lingering between them. This resolution brings clarity and closure to their past relationship, allowing the protagonist to make an informed decision about their future.

9. Happily Ever After (2.5%):
In the concluding phase of the romance book, the story ties up loose ends and provides a satisfying resolution.
