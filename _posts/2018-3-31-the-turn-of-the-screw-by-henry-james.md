### **Blurb:**

A very young woman's first job: governess for two weirdly beautiful, strangely distant, oddly silent children, Miles and Flora, at a forlorn estate...An estate haunted by a beckoning evil.

Half-seen figures who glare from dark towers and dusty windows- silent, foul phantoms who, day by day, night by night, come closer, ever closer. With growing horror, the helpless governess realizes the fiendish creatures want the children, seeking to corrupt their bodies, possess their minds, own their souls...

But worse-much worse- the governess discovers that Miles and Flora have no terror of the lurking evil.

For they want the walking dead as badly as the dead want them. 

### **My Review:**

The Turn of the Screw is a story of a governess who is hired by a man who has become responsible for his young nephew and niece after the death of their parents.

When the governess reaches the estate she realises that there is something creepy about the place and the children.

Some figures glare at her from distant towers and dusty windows and keep coming closer each time.

She realises that the ghost doesn’t want her but the children.

The story contains all the elements of a perfect horror story – spooky house, creepy children, dead figures and undefined relationships between various characters.
This book is recommended to those looking for books of the horror genre.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
