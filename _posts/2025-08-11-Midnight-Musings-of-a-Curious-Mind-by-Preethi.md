### **Blurb:**
A collection of poems written over five years—in quiet corners, chaotic days, and the stillness of midnight, when thoughts often speak the loudest, each poem was sparked by something that moved me: a word, a person, a moment, a memory, or a feeling too big to hold inside. You will find many versions of the author here—the daughter, the wife, the mother, the overthinker, the quiet observer. Some poems ache, some smile, some simply sit beside you. And though they began as mine, you may find a little bit yours too. So breathe. Flip through. Linger. Find yourself?

### **My Review:**
“Midnight Musings of a Curious Mind: Introspection, Learning and Prayer” by Preethi A is a comforting and relatable collection of poems.

I’ll admit, I’m not usually the “poetry person”. Most times, I find myself lost in free-verse pieces that feel a bit too abstract for me to truly connect with. But this collection was different. Preethi’s poems mostly follow classic rhyming styles, and that rhythm gave the reading experience a natural flow. It’s a refreshing change in today’s world where free verse dominates.

The theme is life. Plain, simple, yet beautifully layered. Across just 55 pages, the poems touch on moments and emotions that every reader will recognise: the joy and ache of family bonds, the tenderness of being a daughter or mother, the subtle strength in friendships, and even the shared stillness of pandemic days. It’s a deeply human collection. My personal favourite, ‘Of Duality’, captures the constant balancing act of carrying two personalities that many women live with. It stayed with me.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. It’s short enough to read in a single sitting, yet the lines linger long after you close the book. Whether you’re a seasoned poetry lover or someone like me who usually avoids it, this collection offers a gentle reminder that poetry, at its heart, is simply about connecting.

Suitable for age: 14+
