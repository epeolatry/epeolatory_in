### **Blurb:**

Who Moved My Cheese? is a simple parable that reveals profound truths. It is an amusing and enlightening story of four characters who live in a "Maze" and look for "Cheese" to nourish them and make them happy.

Two are mice named Sniff and Scurry. And two are "Littlepeople"—beings the size of mice who look and act a lot like people. Their names are Hem and Haw.

"Cheese" is a metaphor for what you want to have in life—whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money, a possession, health, or spiritual peace of mind.

And the "Maze" is where you look for what you want—the organization you work in, or the family or community you live in.

In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change. Eventually, one of them deals with it successfully, and writes what he has learned from his experience on the Maze walls.

When you come to see "The Handwriting on the Wall," you can discover for yourself how to deal with change, so that you can enjoy less stress and more success (however you define it) in your work and in your life. 

Written for all ages, the story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last a lifetime. 

### **My Review:**

WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? is a story which tells us the importance of adapting to unexpected changes. Highly recommended in the corporate world by managers, this 90 pages short book can be read, enjoyed and understood by everyone – young or old.

It is a beautiful parable which teaches us a complicated lesson of life in the simplest way.

It reminds us that we should not stop moving. We must always keep pushing, trying new things, and be ready to change.

"The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the OLD, but on building the NEW."
– Socrates

So decide which character you are.

Sniff: One who sniffs all the opportunities and threats as they are approaching.

Scurry: One who scurries into action or take action immediately.

Haw: One who is reluctant to change at first but after seeing no other better alternative decides to change.

Hem: One who is scared of changes and thinks something wrong might happen, hence, doesn’t change at all.
