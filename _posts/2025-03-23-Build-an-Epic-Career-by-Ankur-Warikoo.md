A must-have for anyone entering their 20s!

### **My Review:**
Ankur Warikoo is back with yet another “epic” guide, and this time, he’s tackling careers. "Build an Epic Career" is aimed at Gen Z and Millennials, offering practical career advice in Warikoo’s signature style—short, digestible, and straight to the point. If you’re in your 20s and wondering how to navigate the professional world, this book serves as a useful starting point.

As always, Warikoo keeps things easy to read. The book is structured in bite-sized sections, making it accessible even for those who don’t typically read career guides. He blends personal experiences with actionable insights, covering everything from education choices to financial planning. However, the "How-to" section feels a bit scattered. A more cohesive flow would have made the advice easier to follow.

One noticeable issue is repetition—some points are reiterated multiple times within the same chapter, which could have been avoided with tighter editing. Additionally, the book seems contradictory at times. Warikoo initially emphasizes corporate stability and saving money before exploring one's passions but later encourages early exploration without focusing on financial security. While both perspectives have merit, the inconsistency might leave some readers confused.

The inclusion of #epicjourneys—stories of individuals navigating their careers—is a nice touch, but after a while, they start feeling repetitive. The responses to different questions often seem similar, making this section less impactful than intended.

That said, Warikoo’s signature bullet-point format ensures the book remains practical and engaging. It’s more of a compilation of career advice rather than a definitive roadmap, so readers will need to filter out what works for them. If you enjoy Warikoo’s content, you’ll likely find value here. Just don’t expect groundbreaking insights—this one’s more about reaffirming what you may already know.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
