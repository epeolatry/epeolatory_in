### **My Review:**
I can conveniently say that this is one of the best collection of short stories I have ever read.

A very different perspective of basic things has been put in front. Thoughts which are merely thoughts for us are beautifully expressed through words.

I couldn't believe things as simple as a tree, clouds or an old woman could be described in such words as done by Zuni Chopra.

Being just 17 year old, the view that the writer has about the world makes me believe that the world is a piece of art. All it needs is a person with an eye for that art.

Zuni Chopra talks about everything - war, old age, ghosts, life, island, sea and what not.

Though I loved reading each page and every word of the book but my favourite stories are H.A.U.N.T.E.D. and The Little Matchstick Girl.
These are kind of stories you would love to read to kids as much as you would love to read it for yourself.

Whether you are a reader or not, this book is definitely recommended! 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
