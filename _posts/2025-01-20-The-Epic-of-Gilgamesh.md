### **Blurb:**
The ancient Sumerian poem "The Epic of Gilgamesh" is one of the oldest written stories in existence, translated with an introduction by Andrew George in Penguin Classics.

Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world's oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh's adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, "The Epic of Gilgamesh" is, above all, about mankind's eternal struggle with the fear of death.

The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George's gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluid narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh.

### **My Review:**
“The Epic of Gilgamesh” is a timeless masterpiece and one of the earliest surviving works of literature. Originating from ancient Mesopotamia, it transcends its historical context to explore deeply human concerns, making it relevant even today.

The narrative follows the adventures of Gilgamesh, the king of Uruk, whose arrogance and tyranny lead to the creation of Enkidu, a wild man sent by the gods to challenge him. Their eventual friendship forms the emotional core of the story, driving Gilgamesh’s transformation from a reckless ruler to a reflective seeker of wisdom. The epic brilliantly weaves themes of mortality, friendship, and the pursuit of meaning in a transient world.

What sets “The Epic of Gilgamesh” apart is its rich mythological landscape, populated with gods, monsters, and larger-than-life events. The story's poetic language and universal themes elevate it from mere myth to a profound exploration of human existence. Gilgamesh's quest for immortality and his ultimate acceptance of mortality resonate deeply, offering insights into the human condition.

While its fragmentary nature can pose challenges, modern translations succeed in capturing its essence. For lovers of mythology, history, or existential literature, “The Epic of Gilgamesh” remains a must-read, showcasing the enduring power of storytelling.
