### **Blurb:**
‘Seek and ye shall find.’

With these words echoing in his head, eminent Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon awakes in a hospital bed with no recollection of where he is or how he got there. Nor can he explain the origin of the macabre object that is found hidden in his belongings.

A threat to his life will propel him and a young doctor, Sienna Brooks, into a breakneck chase across the city of Florence. Only Langdon’s knowledge of hidden passageways and ancient secrets that lie behind its historic facade can save them from the clutches of their unknown pursuers.

With only a few lines from Dante’s dark and epic masterpiece, The Inferno, to guide them, they must decipher a sequence of codes buried deep within some of the most celebrated artefacts of the Renaissance – sculptures, paintings, buildings – to find the answers to a puzzle which may, or may not, help them save the world from a terrifying threat…

Set against an extraordinary landscape inspired by one of history’s most ominous literary classics, Inferno is Dan Brown’s most compelling and thought-provoking novel yet, a breathless race-against-time thriller that will grab you from page one and not let you go until you close the book.

### **My Review:**
Inferno by Dan Brown really keeps you on your toes from start to finish. The story is an absolute page-turner. The way the plot unfolds is such a satisfying slow burn. Revelations hit at just the right moments, and the twists kept me hooked throughout.

One of the coolest things about this book is how deeply it dives into art and history. Honestly, it’s impossible to fully appreciate in a single read. I believe you need to read it at least thrice: once for the story, once for the art description, and once for the location descriptions. Right now, I read it purely for the story, but I already can’t wait to go back and explore the art, the Renaissance treasures, and the incredible locations peppered throughout. There’s just so much detail that begs to be looked up—Dante, the mask, the Divine Comedy, museums—you name it.

The character building is solid too. Langdon and Sienna feel real, and their dynamic adds an extra layer of tension to the race-against-time thriller. Overall, it’s gripping, smart, and absolutely worth multiple reads. If you love stories that mix art, history, and suspense seamlessly, Inferno is a must-read.

Suitable for age: 15+
