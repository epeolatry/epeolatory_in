### **My Review:**
In "Tales of Sales" by Priyaranjan Kumar, the overarching theme revolves around the author's personal experiences, skillfully preaching to others the virtues of effective salesmanship. Through 15 real-life narratives, each highlighting a specific quality, the book successfully imparts valuable life lessons applicable not only to sales professionals but to anyone aspiring to enhance their professional acumen.

The characters are not fictional entities but rather reflections of the author's journey through life. Each story highlights the authorâ€™s experience with his colleagues, seniors, clients, partners, etc., imparting wisdom, making the book a personal and relatable exploration of the nuances of successful sales strategies.

Kumar's writing style is characterized by a candid and straightforward approach. However, it is worth noting that the book could benefit from a more meticulous editing process. The presence of numerous errors, detracts from the overall reading experience. Despite this, the author's ability to provide clear explanations of technical jargon adds a layer of accessibility to the content, making it suitable for a broader audience.

The book serves as a valuable resource for those seeking insights into the art of salesmanship through the lens of the author's diverse and enriching life experiences.

I recommend it for those who appreciate learning through real-life experiences, "Tales of Sales" offers a unique perspective on the intricacies of the corporate world. The blend of personal anecdotes and practical advice creates a narrative that is both engaging and instructive.
