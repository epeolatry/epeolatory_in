### **Blurb:**
A flamboyant party host is murdered in full view of a roomful of bridge players... Mr Shaitana was famous as a flamboyant party host. Nevertheless, he was a man of whom everybody was a little afraid. So, when he boasted to Poirot that he considered murder an art form, the detective had some reservations about accepting a party invitation to view Shaitana's private collection. Indeed, what began as an absorbing evening of bridge was to turn into a more dangerous game altogether…

### **My Review:**
“Cards on the Table” by Agatha Christie is a brilliantly crafted mystery—exactly what you’d expect from the Queen of Crime.

She offers just enough clues to make you suspect someone, yet keeps you guessing all the way through. Every character has something that makes them a convincing suspect. There are four of them in this book, each with distinct traits and a unique style of committing murder, which become incredibly helpful in identifying the real culprit.

Even by the end, I couldn’t guess who the murderer was. Just a few pages in, I had a strong hunch about one character, but I couldn’t be further away from the real culprit.

It’s a light, enjoyable read, and I found myself constantly using my “little grey cells” to prove why my chosen suspect was guilty.

Reading Agatha Christie always feels like solving a puzzle alongside her—only to be rewarded with a perfectly delivered solution at the end. That’s what I love about her writing. The language is simple and accessible, making it easy to get immersed.

Overall, after “Murder on the Orient Express”, this is definitely one of my favorites. I can’t wait to dive into more of her books.

Suitable for age: 13+
