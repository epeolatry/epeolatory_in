### **Blurb:**

She turned the key of her car and it sputtered to life. She jammed the accelerator as the engine roared. With all her might, she pulled the gears and the world behind them blurred away. As they pushed past the house, she heard a deafening scream from a familiar voice. “Enigma!” The lady cried as the people in the market turned in hopes of gathering new gossip. Marinated in a world of competition, Snapped Threads is a portrayal of a struggle for justice. The story weaves together diverse lives against the backdrop of an art theft. Renewing the essence of love, friendship, betrayal, ambition and greed, the story is a reflection of an encounter made at the crossroads of deception and loyalty. The characters embark on new journeys-some with the desires to fulfill dreams, some to satisfy the hunger for wealth and power and some in search of acceptance in an altering world. A tryst with life and a celebration of love, the crime thriller is set at the dawn of a new beginning, bringing into its folds the commitments, responsibilities and perceptions that result from a serious theme attempted in a light environment. Flip through the pages to discover how the characters eventually let the threads roll out the paths of these new journeys. 

### **My Review:**

Snapped Threads is a refreshing story about an art theft. It is brilliantly written in a very simplistic manner. 

What is surprising is that the story is written by a 16 year old girl. The knowledge that the author holds about art, exhibitions, and "the dark world" is commendable. 

The book talks about love, friendship, betrayal, lust and greed for power and fame. How a person would go to any extent to fulfill his desires. It also stresses on the theme that a person with good intentions can make a bad person realise their mistakes and the harm they have caused to others.

The character development was excellent. How the characters are made to do things they would have never wanted to do just because someone was able to hit their weakest chord and manipulate them to do things.

It is a mostly unpredictable story with lots of twists and turns.Though some stupid acts done by characters which were totally unreasonable and were disappointing.

The story was able to keep me hooked since beginning. As I progressed towards the end of the book, I was wondering whether the story is going to have a satisfactory end or am I going to be left at a cliffhanger. But I must say that the author gave an end to the story, which might slightly appear rushed up, but completes the story. A bit more details though would have made the book more loveable.

Definitely recommended for a refreshing read, with a good amount of thrill.
