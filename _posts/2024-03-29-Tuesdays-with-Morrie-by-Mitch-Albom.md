### **Blurb:**
Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, and gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was Morrie Schwartz, his college professor from nearly twenty years ago.

Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you?

Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying of ALS - or motor neurone disease - Mitch visited Morrie in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final 'class': lessons in how to live.

### **My Review:**
> “I traded a lot of dreams for a bigger paycheck, and I never even realized I was doing it.” 

"Tuesdays with Morrie" by Mitch Albom is based on a true story, delving into the profound relationship between a student and his mentor, exploring themes of life, love, and mortality. The plot revolves around Mitch Albom's reconnection with his former college professor, Morrie Schwartz, as he comes to know about Morrie's terminal illness. Through a series of Tuesday meetings, Mitch learns invaluable life lessons from Morrie, ultimately transforming his perspective on what truly matters in life.

Mitch skillfully weaves themes of compassion, forgiveness, and the pursuit of happiness throughout the narrative. Morrie's teachings on embracing vulnerability and finding joy in the midst of suffering resonated deeply with me, prompting introspection and self-reflection. The book serves as a reminder to cherish meaningful connections and live authentically in the face of adversity.

Mitch's writing style is both engaging and emotive, capturing the essence of Morrie's wisdom with sincerity and depth. The Q&A format of the book (much similar to The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari and Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo) provides a conversational tone that invites readers to participate in Morrie and Mitch's intimate discussions. Mitch's poignant portrayal of Morrie's declining health is both heart-wrenching and inspiring, reminding us of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing every moment.

Both the main characters in "Tuesdays with Morrie" are richly developed, each contributing to the overarching themes of the story. Their dynamic relationship is portrayed with authenticity and vulnerability. Morrie emerges as a compassionate and insightful mentor, while Mitch undergoes a transformative journey of self-discovery and personal growth. I love how Mitch's character is developed throughout his interaction with Morrie. He like many of us is skeptical about what the old man has to say, but gradually he not only understands him better he also grows closer to him. Emotionally and physically.

I enjoyed how the book preaches without being preachy. There are no lengthy discussions about a topic but a quick acknowledgment and addressing of the various aspects of our lives.

I highly recommend "Tuesdays with Morrie" for its powerful storytelling and profound insights into the human experience. Whether you're seeking wisdom, comfort, or simply a compelling narrative, this book offers invaluable lessons that will stay with you long after you turn the final page.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
