### **My Review:**
"Just Go After" by Mirajj Thakker is an interesting exploration of the author’s personal and academic growth, with insightful lessons. The author's ability to convey valuable lessons on every page transforms the book into an ongoing source of wisdom.

Tech enthusiasts will find an added layer of intrigue as the author intricately weaves his narrative with each pursued project, providing readers with a unique perspective and firsthand experiences. Being from a commerce background, I felt a little disconnected from the topics of the projects, but nonetheless, the thrill of learning about the author’s struggle through each competition kept me hooked.

The book delves into the challenges of college life, depicting the perpetual struggle of balancing high exam scores with active participation in extracurricular activities, events, competitions, and internships — a relatable journey for many.

A poignant moment on page 118 serves as a reminder of the equality within the college community, emphasizing that everyone possesses similar resources and intellect. Thakker skillfully demonstrates that, ultimately, the combination of CGPA and active involvement in events shapes better opportunities.

The book masterfully captures the authentic struggles of students, highlighting the significance of networking and gaining new experiences during the student journey. It emphasizes that such efforts not only set individuals apart but also instill the confidence necessary to confront challenging situations.

I myself have been an introverted student throughout my schooling. Despite introversion, I actively participated in diverse competitions and events, even in areas of limited knowledge. It became a deliberate choice throughout my bachelor's degree. This ensured that I had fun as I met new people and got opportunities to learn.

"Just Go After" is a thought-provoking and enriching read that I would recommend to high-school and college students, who are interested in getting a realistic view of college life, which is far away from what we know by watching and reading fiction.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
