### **Blurb:**
The 500-year-old saga of courage, faith and valour of the Karamsot Rathores remains unparalleled.

Kesariya: An Ode to the Karamsot Rathores of Kheenvsar brings to life the extraordinary story of one of Marwar’s most distinguished Rajput lineages.

Descendants of the mighty Rashtrakuta kings—whose prowess once thundered across central and southern India—the Rathores became the very heart and soul of Marwar, their blood fortifying the towering walls of Mehrangarh.

In 1523 CE, Rao Karamsiji, the ninth son of the legendary Rathore king, Rao Jodha, founded the kingdom of Kheenvsar (Khimsar). Guided by a divine calling and a warrior’s resolve, he began the indelible legacy of the Karamsot Rathores. Spanning twenty-one generations, the Karamsots are among the world’s only Rajput dynasties with an unbroken line of descent.

A living legacy of valour

Fearless, loyal and formidable on the battlefield, and committed, compelling and unyielding at the negotiating table, the Karamsot dynasty of Kheenvsar has not only been a defining force in Marwar’s glorious history but also stands as a living testament to Rajput pride and honour.

Drawn from rare, handwritten family archives, Kesariya is the first-ever chronicle to emerge from within the house of Kheenvsar. Through meticulous research and powerful storytelling, Urvashi Singh—a descendant of this proud lineage—immortalizes the heroes of Kheenvsar and their enduring legacy that continues to inspire.

A chronicle of heritage and heart

Kesariya is more than a historical account: it is an ode to identity, lineage and belonging. By bridging centuries of Rajput tradition with the present, it revives the forgotten voices of Marwar and preserves their spirit for generations to come.

For lovers of history, heritage and storytelling, this book stands as a reminder that courage, once kindled, never truly fades. It continues to burn bright in every descendant who carries the name, the memory and the pride of Rajputana.

### **My Review:**
I am not generally a fan of history. My only memories of the subject is associated with confusing years, difficult exams, and strict teachers.

I will be honest, I picked up this fully expecting an epic fiction. Turns out it isn't. It's a proper history book.

But, to my surprise, it hooked me.

Within the first few pages, the book presents a detailed chart of rulers and governors in the Centre and Marwar, spanning from 1200 CE to the present day. While I don’t retain most of the names and years (not that anyone is going to take a test), the timeline helps in visualising shifts in power and lineage over centuries.

The book brings forth several lesser-known tales of the Karamsots and their valour, empathy, leadership, and bravery, adding depth to a history that often feels distant or abstract.

Personally, I found myself most drawn to the stories of the princesses and queens, whose presence quietly but powerfully provides richness to the narrative.

I have closely known some of the locations mentioned in the book, yet neither I, nor my parents, nor my grandparents, were aware of the rich history of the land, the stories of courage, or even Karamsots. Glad I picked this book. Another addition to the books about the places I have been to.
