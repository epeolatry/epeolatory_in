### **My Review:**
Nishit Mistry’s “Soul’s Eternal Path: Journey Beyond Light and Karma” is a deeply meditative exploration of existence, consciousness, and the soul’s evolution. Blending poetic prose with philosophical insight, the book brings together mythology, science, and spirituality to offer a refreshingly holistic narrative of life.

The author’s writing style is crisp, inviting readers into a thoughtful conversation while never losing them in abstraction. The chapters flow seamlessly, each carrying a distinct resonance yet being part of a larger, purposeful arc. 

What sets this book apart is its accessibility. Without preaching or overwhelming, it nudges the curious reader, seeker and sceptic alike, towards introspection. It doesn’t claim to answer life’s big questions, but rather creates space for readers to ask their own with depth and sincerity.
Whether you’re beginning your spiritual journey or want support on an existing path, “Soul’s Eternal Path” is a thoughtful and beautifully crafted companion worth having on your shelf.
