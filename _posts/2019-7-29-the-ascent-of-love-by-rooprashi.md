### **Blurb:**

When Taara met Vedant, she fell in love for the first time. However, she could not perceive that a feeling as pure as love can turn into something so toxic for her. 

As she decided to leave her love behind and climb peaks of the world, she knew that the love for the peaks was not hers either. 

As she questions herself and is inept to understand why she is not able to forget her past, her ascent to the peaks was making the difference apparent to her. Something she already knew. 

Had she found a new love, or was love back in an old package to spite her again? Does a difficult mountaineering course in Kashmir prove to be the turning point in her life? Will she be able to complete her 'Ascent of Love' the way she intended to, or will a hailstorm change the plan of her life? 

### **My Review:**

The Ascent of Love is the love story of Vedanth and Taara through the point of view of Taara, mostly set across the beauty of mountains and having a cameo of a storm.

The story is cliché romance which is nicely written. It takes you on a trip to Kashmir without you having to move an inch. 
The description of places and the beauty wants you to pack your bags and leave for Kashmir immediately. You can feel the serenity and the winds. (Lol no! That last part was a bit of exaggeration. You can't feel the serenity and winds when the temperature around is nearly 50°C)

The story transitions between past and present to simultaneously present the story of Taara and Vedanth over the leap of 5 years.

It was an enjoyable and fast read. You can't expect any twists and turns with this story.

The cover and the title are fitting for the storyline. The cover especially seems to come straight out of a movie poster.

Recommended for a light, cliché, not at all explicit romance.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
