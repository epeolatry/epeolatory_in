### **My Review:**
I have known Aritra Sarkar for a while, and he is one of the kindest and nicest people I know. So, when he published “Stress to Zest”, I knew I had to read it.

The book is divided into seven simple topics addressing the causes of stress: relationships, parents, society, finance, health, jobs, and competition. It’s the perfect go-to read for those moments when life feels overwhelming. With separate chapters dedicated to each issue, it’s easy to pick up and refer to whenever you feel stuck in any area of life.

This isn’t your typical self-help book. In fact, I’d argue it’s not a conventional non-fiction book at all. “Stress to Zest” is a unique blend of seven short stories interwoven with the author’s personal insights into these areas of stress.

The stories, which lean towards magical realism, are deeply thought-provoking and leave a lasting impact long after you’ve finished reading.

What stands out to me is how Aritra Sarkar shares personal anecdotes, struggles, and lessons from his own life. His willingness to be vulnerable makes the writing feel authentic and relatable.

I appreciate books that don’t preach but instead share experiences, allowing readers to draw their own conclusions. “Stress to Zest” does exactly that.

While not everyone might connect with the lessons conveyed through its stories, if you’re someone who learns better from others’ experiences rather than a list of dos and don’ts, this book is an absolute must-read.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
