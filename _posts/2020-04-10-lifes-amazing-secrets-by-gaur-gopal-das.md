### **Blurb:**
While navigating their way through Mumbai's horrendous traffic, Gaur Gopal Das and his wealthy young friend Harry get talking, delving into concepts ranging from the human condition to finding one's purpose in life and the key to lasting happiness. Whether you are looking at strengthening your relationships, discovering your true potential, understanding how to do well at work or even how you can give back to the world, Gaur Gopal Das takes us on an unforgettable journey with his precious insights on these areas of life. Das is one of the most popular and sought-after monks and life coaches in the world, having shared his wisdom with millions. His debut book, Life's Amazing Secrets, distils his experiences and lessons about life into a light-hearted, thought-provoking book that will help you align yourself with the life you want to live. 

### **My Review:**
Life's amazing secrets are a self-help book in the form of fiction. The writing style is simple. If you are not into self-help books or reading, then this book is a good start.

Gaur Gopal Das meets his wealthy friend, Harry over lunch. They start to talk about Harry's successful and happy life. But everything is not as good as it seems.
The narrator understands the situation and starts talking about 4 wheels of life - Personal Life, Relationships, Work-Life, and Social Contribution: and how it is important to focus on each one of them for a perfect life.
The narrator takes examples from his life to explain each aspect of life to Harry.
Step by step, he takes the reader through all the 4 wheels of life. Each of the 4 parts is further divided into segments to be worked upon to improve in that area. The division is not a very rigid one. Improving one segment could help you improve in more than one area.
A few chapters that I personally loved are Growing through Gratitude, Correcting Cautiously, and Decoding Spirituality at Work.

The narrator also talks about Ikigai in the end - why should we have an Ikigai and how can we find ours.

I really recommend this book.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
