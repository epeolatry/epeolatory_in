The ellipsis, a punctuation mark consisting of three dots, is a powerful tool in fiction writing. It can be used to convey a wide range of emotions, from hesitation and uncertainty to tension and anticipation. Here are five ways to use ellipses in fiction:

To indicate hesitation or uncertainty: Ellipses can be used to show a character's hesitation or uncertainty in their speech. For example, "I don't know if I should...well, never mind." This use of ellipses can create a sense of ambiguity and leave the reader wondering what the character was going to say. 

To indicate a pause or interruption: Ellipses can also be used to show a pause or interruption in a character's speech. For example: The employee was saying, "I suggest we…” but the boss interrupted him. This use of ellipses can create a sense of tension or anticipation as the reader waits to see what the character was going to say.

To create a cliffhanger: Ellipses can be used to create a cliffhanger at the end of a chapter or scene. For example, "As I turned the corner, I saw...". This use of ellipses can create a sense of suspense and leave the reader eager to find out what happens next.

To convey a trailing off or fading out: Ellipses can be used to convey a trailing off or fading out of a character's speech. For example, "I don't think I can...". This use of ellipses can create a sense of ambiguity and emphasis on emotions like sadness, fear, or the feeling of not being heard.

In conclusion, the ellipsis is a powerful tool in fiction writing that can be used to convey a wide range of emotions and create a sense of tension and anticipation. By using ellipses to indicate hesitation or uncertainty, pauses or interruptions, cliffhangers, and trailing off or fading out, writers can add depth and nuance to their characters and scenes.
