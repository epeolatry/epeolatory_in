Making characters opposite of each other is not equal to making them unique. 

When creating characters, writers should be mindful of not just giving their characters polar opposite traits. Doing so can make them one-dimensional and cause readers to be less invested in the story. 

Having characters with opposite traits can be used as a tool in storytelling, but it should be done sparingly. Rather than relying solely on polar opposites, they should be given traits that are both positive and negative, as well as a variety of strengths and weaknesses. This will give them more depth and make them more relatable to the audience.

Giving characters realistic motivations and goals can also help to create a more engaging narrative. They should have their own set of flaws and aspirations that are not just the opposite of another character's. 

In the end, writers should strive to create characters that are complex and believable, rather than just a collection of conflicting traits. Doing so will help to make the story more interesting and enjoyable for readers.

### *Happy Writing!*
