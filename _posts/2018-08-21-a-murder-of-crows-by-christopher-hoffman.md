### **Blurb:**
 In 1945, at the end of World War 2, Joseph Stalin did not believe that Adolf Hitler would remain in his bunker and take his own life. Figuring the German Fuhrer was too cocky, egotistical, and narcissistic, it must be a rouse giving him time to escape Berlin. With no confirmable facts provided to the public, Stalin unleashes Mikael his “Fixer” to hunt down and kill a list of escaped, high ranking, dangerous Nazis and their leader.
After several years and little luck, the trail was getting cold. Mikael makes a bold move and trades in his team of soldiers for a handpicked band of misfits, each with their own specialty along with a need for redemption. Can this rag tag eccentric group do better than the elite forces that were previously sent on this mission? They will need to, if they intend on changing the course of history as we know it.
A Murder of Crows was originally written as a pay television series. The long awaited conversion to novel format has finally arrived. Be sure to check out other books in the Fairchild Mystery-Thriller series where the author blends real life facts with his fictional team.

### **My Review:**
It is a cleverly written book combining facts with fiction. I liked the concept. Though I am not really a history enthusiast, I did enjoy this story.
But I would like to warn the readers of dark and violent content of the story. It contains a lot of scenes of murder and torture.

The book though written from third person's perspective very smartly takes up to first person's perspective while reading through Henry's journals. The perspective and timezones shifts very neatly from one to another and back.

I liked Abigail and Finn a lot. They are young, smart and wise beyond their years. They solve the mystery started by Abigail's grandfather and are not scared to follow his footsteps for the sake of justice.

There are lot of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. Looks like the book wasn't edited even once. This make the the story a little dull. Had that thing been taken care of, I would have definitely given it 5⭐

### ***Happy Reading!!***
