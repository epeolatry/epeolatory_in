### **Blurb:**
The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a story about what it’s like to travel that strange course through the uncharted territory of high school. The world of first dates, family dramas, and new friends. Of sex, drugs, and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Of those wild and poignant roller-coaster days known as growing up.

### **My Review:**
Stephen Chbosky’s "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" attempts to capture the tumultuous journey of the protagonist and narrator, Charlie, through high school, filled with first dates, family dramas, and the exploration of identity. Initially, the story intrigued me as it delved into Charlie’s life. His struggles with mental health, his life as an introvert, and the complexities of high school life were engaging. Charlie’s perspective as a thoughtful observer, genuinely interested in the lives of others, offered a refreshing contrast to Holden Caulfield from "The Catcher in the Rye".

However, the narrative loses its momentum in the second half. The story seemed to meander, lacking a clear direction or purpose. This drifting plot made it difficult to stay engaged, as the numerous social issues introduced were never fully explored or resolved. They often felt like fleeting mentions rather than meaningful commentary, forgotten as quickly as they were introduced.

The first-person point of view, while initially compelling, became tedious. Similar to my experience with "The Catcher in the Rye", I found the stream-of-consciousness style overwhelming and boring. The simplicity of the writing, intended to reflect a 15-year-old’s voice, felt overly simplistic, almost to the point of being dumbed down.

Despite the multitude of events and emotions presented, none resonated deeply. The constant flux left little room to sit with and fully experience any particular moment or feeling. Ultimately, while Charlie’s character had potential, the execution left me unfulfilled. The story, laden with potential, never quite delivered, resulting in an underwhelming reading experience.

I think this book is overhyped and there are more interesting and authentic pieces of literature out there. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
