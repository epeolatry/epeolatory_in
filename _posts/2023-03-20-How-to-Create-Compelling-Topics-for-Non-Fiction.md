Non-fiction writing is a genre that seeks to inform, educate, or persuade the reader on a particular subject. The challenge for non-fiction writers is creating compelling and engaging topics that will capture the reader's attention and keep them interested throughout the article or book. In this blog, we'll explore five ways to create such topics.

**Focus on the reader's pain points**
One of the most effective ways to create engaging non-fiction topics is by focusing on the reader's pain points. Identify the problems or challenges that your readers are facing, and craft a topic that speaks directly to those issues. For instance, if you are writing about financial management, you could create a topic such as "5 easy steps to take control of your finances and reduce stress."

**Use storytelling**
Storytelling is a powerful tool that can make even the most mundane topics interesting. By using anecdotes or real-life examples, you can make your non-fiction writing relatable and engaging. For example, if you are writing about leadership, you could use stories of successful leaders to illustrate your points.

**Take a unique angle**
One way to create a compelling topic for non-fiction is to take a unique angle. Look for a perspective that hasn't been explored before or an approach that is different from the norm. For instance, if you are writing about nutrition, you could take a unique angle by focusing on how certain foods can boost your brainpower.

**Use provocative or intriguing titles**
Provocative or intriguing titles can grab the reader's attention and make them want to read more. Use a title that piques the reader's interest, such as "The surprising benefits of boredom" or "Why failure is the key to success." However, it is important to ensure that the title accurately reflects the content of the article or book.

**Address current trends or issues**
Writing about current trends or issues is an excellent way to create engaging non-fiction topics. Look for topics that are currently making headlines or that are on the minds of your readers. For instance, if you are writing about environmental sustainability, you could address the impact of climate change on food production.

In conclusion, creating compelling and engaging topics for non-fiction writing requires careful thought and consideration. By focusing on the reader's pain points, using storytelling, taking a unique angle, using provocative or intriguing titles, and addressing current trends or issues, you can craft topics that will capture your readers' attention and keep them engaged throughout your article or book.
