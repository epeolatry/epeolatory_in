Books hold the power to transport us to different worlds, broaden our perspectives, and inspire our imagination. While the literary landscape is brimming with contemporary releases, there's a certain allure to exploring the timeless classics. 

*Note: It is important to note that the status of books in the public domain can vary from one country to another. While some books may have entered the public domain in one country, they might still be protected by copyright in another. Therefore, when exploring the availability of books in the public domain, it is essential to consider the copyright laws of the specific country you are in or accessing the books from. These laws govern the duration of copyright protection, which is typically determined by factors such as the year of publication, the year of the author's death, or specific legal provisions. To ensure compliance with copyright regulations and to determine the public domain status of a book, consulting the copyright laws of the respective country is highly recommended. By being aware of and respecting these laws, we can navigate the world of literature with a clear understanding of what works are freely accessible and what may still be protected by copyright.*
