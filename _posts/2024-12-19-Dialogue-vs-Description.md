Dialogue and description are two essential elements of storytelling. However, knowing when to use each can be a challenge. Here are some tips to help you decide when to let your characters speak and when to narrate.

**1. Where to use dialogues:**
Use dialogue to reveal character traits, motivations, and backstory. Dialogue should also be used to create tension, conflict, or suspense. Finally, use dialogue to convey important information or plot points. These points are best to be shown in dialogues rather than descriptions.

**2. Where to use description:**
On the other hand, use a description to set the scene or establish an atmosphere. The description should also be used to provide background information or context. Finally, use the description to create a sense of pace or tension.

**3. Avoid information dumps:**
Avoid information dumping, whether through dialogue or description. It can slow down your narrative and bore your readers. Avoid giving unnecessary information about characters, plots, environment etc. Keep it concise and short.

**4. Mix Up:**
Vary your sentence structure to create a sense of rhythm and flow. Mix up short and long sentences to keep your readers engaged. You should use the show, don’t tell technique. Rather than telling your readers what’s happening, show them through action, dialogue, and description.

It’s important to create a compelling balance between dialogues and descriptions. However, one must understand that these tips are subjective, and the writer should try to find their own balance based on their story’s requirements.
