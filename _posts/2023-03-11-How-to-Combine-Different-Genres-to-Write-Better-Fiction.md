Fiction writing is a creative process that allows authors to create interesting and unique stories. The genre of a work is the specific style or category it falls into. While some authors prefer to focus on a single genre in their work, others may enjoy combining genres to create something new and exciting. Combining genres can help authors explore new ideas and create unique stories. Here are the five best combinations of genres to help you write better fiction.

1. Historical Fiction & Fantasy: 
Historical fiction is a genre that focuses on past eras and historical events. Combining historical fiction with fantasy elements such as magical creatures, wizards, and other mythical elements can create a unique and imaginative story. For example, the Lord of the Ring series

3. Fantasy & Romance: 
Fantasy and romance are two genres that can be combined to create an incredible story. The examples in this mix are endless like the books by Holly Balck, Sarah J Maas, and Cassandra Clare.

4. Mystery & Thriller:
