### **Blurb:**
A traumatising theft on assignment leaves twenty-eight-year-old content writer Piyanjali Kumari with this crazy epiphany. Her numerous attempts to meet TV heartthrob Vian Rustom go in vain. That’s when her guardian angel tells her the one thing she needs to do to make things happen. Desperate, she takes the plunge. But sh*t keeps going wrong. And PiKu realises her story with ViRu is destined to end in only one way—heartbreak.

Will PiKu be able to win ViRu’s love? Will she get the romance of her dreams? Or will it be the darkest nightmare of her life?

PiKu & ViRu is an emotional roller coaster that promises to take you places.

### **My Review:**
The story line is very unique. It is presented in a very realistic way. Every person having a crush on a celebrity can very well relate to the emotions of PiKu. Though quite real on PiKu’s part, the story shows the negative side of celebrities through ViRu’s character.

I loved the way in which the author has been able to present PiKu’s guardian angel as a guide who doesn’t give away much (more like gut feeling and intuition).

The writing style is simple yet compelling. The story is easy to dive into. It is not very predictable and keeps you hooked to know what happens next.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
