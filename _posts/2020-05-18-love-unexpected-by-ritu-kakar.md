### **My Review:**
Love Unexpected revolves around the life of the protagonist, Kaira. Having a bad relationship in the past, she is now trying to focus solely on her Café Library. She is pretty sure that "love" is not for her until she bumps into a mystery man and all those tingling sensations start coming to her.
I loved the simplicity of the writing style. The title and the blurb don't leave much to wonder. But the moments in the story are cute, and keeps you hooked.
It is our usual romantic comedy. A career-oriented female lead with a dark past, an overly - almost unrealistically - handsome male lead with no defects, bump into each other out of nowhere, and fall in love. 
Along with the love story of Kaira, it is also the story of friendship between Kaira and Tasha, and their journey through the thick and thin. Kaira and Sam depict a great brother-sister relationship and their banters are fun to read.
As interesting the plot and the writing was, I believe that the characters do lack some depth. Aveer is introduced in the story but his past is nowhere under discussion. At one point we see Kaira searching through the magazines and internet about this top publisher, but she finds no personal life details of this guy. I think this was preferred by the writer to get away from going into details of the character. But, that would have certainly made the character more lovable.
Similarly, Drew was simply a douchebag character. Some efforts could have been made into making his character reasonable. 
Nevertheless, it was a fun read.
Recommended if you are looking for afun, quick, and light-hearted read.
