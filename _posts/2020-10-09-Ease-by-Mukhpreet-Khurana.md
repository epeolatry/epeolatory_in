### **Blurb:**
"Ease" is a poetic journey within. It is an attempt to take a dive deep into the self, a place of acknowledgement, of appreciation, and of celebration of our individuality. The book revolves around the theme "comfortable in my own skin" as it touches the softness and the power of self-love, self-healing, gratitude, and greater good. Ease is a collection of raw, unfiltered, and simple poems. Ease is a collection of poetry, art, and of different writers in collaboration.

It is about blooming, about how you are all you could ever ask for. Ease is a part of the author in words seeking to be a part of your journey. Ease is his present to you, it is his journey to you, for you.

### **My Review:**
"Ease" is a collection of poetries and proses revolving around the themes of self-love, friendships, relationships, moving on, learning, and growing. 

The title and the cover resonates the themes of the book.
Ease (n):
- absence of rigidity or discomfort; poise.
- freedom from worries or problems.

What word could have better defined it in as less as 4 letters?

The white satin cloth in the cover represents the lightness, peacefulness, and comfort of the words inside.

The writing style is simple and easy to understand. The words don't hit you hard, it rather comforts you like a blanket and a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly night.

I read this book two times over a year. Both the times I experienced a very different kind of belongingness and understanding towards to world that the author took me in, towards life, and towards myself.

This book is an escape from reality. You can look forward to reading it whenever you are feeling upset or angry about something. It provides you a much-wanted solace, in the hectic life and busy schedules.

Definitely recommended for readers, non-readers, "non-fiction only" readers. Basically anyone.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
