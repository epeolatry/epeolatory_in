### **My Review:**
"The Padmas: Fifty Stories of Perseverance" by Neha J Hiranandani is a tribute to the extraordinary individuals who have been honored with India's prestigious Padma Awards. This collection of fifty stories celebrates the indomitable spirit and unwavering determination of artists, scientists, freedom fighters, social workers, sports stars, and many others who have left an indelible mark on society.

One of the most captivating aspects of the book is the diverse array of narratives it presents. From familiar names whose backgrounds I was already acquainted with to lesser-known figures whose stories left me awe-inspired, each account is a testament to the power of perseverance. Reading about these remarkable individuals gave me goosebumps as I delved deeper into their journeys, witnessing firsthand the trials and triumphs they faced along the way.

What makes "The Padmas" particularly motivational and inspiring is its emphasis on the universal qualities of determination, perseverance, and courage. Regardless of their fields or backgrounds, each honoree exemplifies these virtues, proving that with unwavering resolve, anything is possible. As I turned the pages, I found myself drawn into a world where obstacles were overcome, dreams were pursued relentlessly, and barriers were shattered with unwavering resilience.

Adding to the book's allure are the beautiful illustrations by David Yambem. These exquisite artworks not only complement the stories but also serve as visual reminders of the resilience and strength embodied by the individuals depicted. Through David's masterful creations, the essence of each honoree's journey is vividly brought to life, further enriching the reading experience.

In commemorating seventy years of the Padma Awards, "The Padmas" serves as a poignant reminder of the extraordinary contributions made by individuals from all walks of life. It inspires young readers to dream big and persevere in the face of adversity, reminding them that greatness lies within their reach.
