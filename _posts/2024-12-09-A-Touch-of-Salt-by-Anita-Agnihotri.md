### **Blurb:**
Mahatma Gandhi to Dandi, and become a part of the historic violation of the Salt Act in British India. This is, of course, unrecorded by history. He was an Agariya, one of the salt-harvesters in the Rann of Kutch. Today, the Agariyas working in the salt pans have no water, homes or schools for their children. They are being squeezed out by the law that has identified the entire Rann as reserved forest for wild asses. Tribhuban’s grandson Azad has no choice but to take up the fight for salt against the establishment once more, this time in an independent India.

A Touch of Salt is the story of Tribhuban and Azad, of Mohandas and Kasturba, of Malati and Vishnuram, of the multitude of Agariyas, countless lives lived, lost, and buried in salt and sand.

### **My Review:**
"A Touch of Salt" is a historical fiction rooted in the oft-forgotten lives of the Agariyas—the salt harvesters of the Rann of Kutch. The book is translated from Bangla by Arunava Sinha.

The novel’s plot is strong. It presents how the Salt March led by Mahatma Gandhi, while monumental in ensuring that basic necessities remained tax-free under the British regime, barely helped the salt producers who continued to toil in oppressive conditions. Tribhuvan’s story transitions through time, culminating in his grandson Azad’s defiant stand in modern India. We also learn more about Mahatma Gandhi’s leadership in those trying times. Through these characters, Agnihotri portrays the raw reality of those whose livelihood remains tied to salt—a bitter irony considering the very symbol it became for freedom. 

However, despite its powerful premise and the potential for deep emotional resonance, the novel struggles to sustain its impact. The transitions between past and present are abrupt and disorienting, making it difficult to maintain a connection with the narrative. This structural flaw detracts from the flow of the story, which could have been more emotionally stirring.

Despite this, “A Touch of Salt” succeeds in giving readers an essential glimpse into the overlooked plight of the Agariyas, framing their historical and present-day struggles with nuance and dignity.

“A Touch of Salt” is an enlightening read for those interested in the lesser-told stories of India’s socio-political landscape. While it may not reach its full emotional potential, it’s an important literary work that sheds light on the lives of those who live and die surrounded by salt—a stark reminder of both resilience and neglect.
