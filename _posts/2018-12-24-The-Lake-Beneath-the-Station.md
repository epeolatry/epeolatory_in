### **My Review:**
The Lake Beneath the Station is a collection of 6 phantom stories. Each unique in its own way.

The stories are written in simple English language (meant for the benefit of English learners - beginners level).

The stories are based on unrealistic ideas. Although most of the stories revolve around ghostly and paranormal plots, they are not scary. Instead they can be called goofy.(Recommended for weak hearted :-P )

The best part about this collection of stories is that even though they are simplistically written, each story unfolds unpredictabily. These stories are suitable for all ages. It is a short and light read.

I would really recommend this book to everyone, especially the language learners. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
