### **Blurb:**
Witty, wise and bittersweet, "The Catcher in the Rye" is the ultimate American coming-of-age novel - a timeless classic.

'If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.'

The first of J. D. Salinger's four books to be published, "The Catcher in the Rye" is one of the most widely read and beloved of all contemporary American novels.

### **My Review:**
J. D. Salinger’s “The Catcher in the Rye” follows Holden Caulfield as he navigates his adolescent angst through a stream-of-consciousness narrative. While the novel is hailed as a coming-of-age classic, I found it lacking in plot development and character arc.

It's a constant monologue that never seems to end. The protagonist endlessly narrates his thoughts about friends, acquaintances, and women. The narrative consistently reflects Holden's black-and-white views on right and wrong, good and bad, highlighting his self-obsession and privilege.

Midway through, the book becomes tedious because nothing significant happens; it’s just Holden recounting his life and experiences. Imagine a TED speaker droning on for hours about personal anecdotes and opinions on various topics—eventually, it gets dull, right? That’s how I felt halfway through this book. I couldn’t see the point in continuing, but I persevered. It reads like a memoir in a conversational style, but the conversation is entirely one-sided.

Honestly, there’s little substance to the story. The resolution was understandable, providing insight into the author's intent for the character, but overall, it's not a book I would recommend.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
