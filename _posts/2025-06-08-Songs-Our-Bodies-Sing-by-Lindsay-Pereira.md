### **Blurb:**
A heartbroken father in London turns to the Beatles to make sense of what he has lost. An antique dealer in Bombay rejects jingoism in favour of racism. Two immigrants in Toronto look for ways of belonging with a local rock band. And, in Paris, a tourist rejects long-held ideas about trust.

The East and West have clashed in innumerable ways since each first acknowledged the existence of the other. The stories of “Songs Our Bodies Sing” are set at these points of intersection. What they reveal are commonalities rather than differences, with protagonists on opposite sides of an imaginary divide, trapped in boxes of their own making.

This collection pulls back a curtain ever so slightly, in ways that are strange yet tender, to show how our struggles to understand the human condition are the same, wherever we are.

### **My Review:**
“Songs Our Bodies Sing” by Lindsay Pereira is a collection of nine short stories, each featuring distinct characters grappling with grief, identity, migration, and belonging. Themes of loss, cultural conflict, and emotional isolation recur throughout. Despite their diverse settings, the characters are united by their quiet search for meaning and connection through music and memory.

I loved how the book explores emotional struggles not just in foreign lands but also within one’s own country. The writing style is engaging from the very first page, with brilliant use of detail and description. There’s even a touch of humour that lightens some heavy moments. 

My personal favourites were ‘The Antique Shop’ and ‘In Your Eyes’. These are the ones I’ll remember every time I look at this book. These stories prove how you can elevate simple observations and thoughts through powerful storytelling.
What didn’t work as well for me was the fifth story, ‘If You Don’t Weaken’. It felt slower and somewhat stretched as if extended just to meet a target word count.

Overall, this is a poignant and beautifully written collection, best suited for readers aged 16 and above due to sensitive themes like racism, suicide, and death.

Suitable for age: 16+
