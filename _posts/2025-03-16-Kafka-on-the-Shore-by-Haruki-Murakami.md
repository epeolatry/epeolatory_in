### **Blurb:**
Kafka Tamura runs away from home at fifteen, under the shadow of his father’s dark prohecy.

The ageing Nakata, tracker of lost cats, who never recovered from a bizarre childhood affliction, finds his pleasantly simplified life suddenly turned upside down.

As their parallel odeysseys unravel, cats converse with people; fish tumble from the sky, a ghost-like pimp deploys a Hegel-spouting girl of the night; a forest harbours soldiers apparently un-aged since World War II. There is a savage killing, but the identity of both victim and killer is a riddle — one of many which combine to create an elegant and dreamlike masterpiece.

### **My Review:**
Haruki Murakami’s “Kafka on the Shore” is a wild, mesmerizing ride—part dream, part reality, and entirely unforgettable. The story follows two seemingly separate but strangely connected characters: Kafka Tamura and Nakata. As their journeys unfold, surreal and mystical things start happening.

One of the best things about this book is its characters. They feel so real, each with their own quirks and depth. Kafka is independent and determined, Nakata is simple yet wise, and Miss Saeki carries a deep, haunting sadness. Oshima is sharp and insightful, while Hoshino, though a bit irritating at first, grows into someone you can’t help but like. Their individual journeys are fascinating, but it’s their development that really makes the story shine.

Murakami’s writing has a way of pulling you in. It’s not a fast-paced thriller, but it’s gripping in a different way—slow, thoughtful, and full of layers. Every chapter makes you pause and think, as you uncover the story’s mysteries. 

TW: The story involves taboo topics like incest and non-consensual sex/rape. However, it is very tastefully executed.

Music plays a huge role in the story too. Much like how “Butter” by Asako Yuzuki deepened my appreciation for food, “Kafka on the Shore” made me fall in love with music in a new way. Both the music and the book recommendations shared within these pages are brilliant. I can’t wait to explore them for myself.

The line between reality and fantasy blurs constantly, and Murakami never hands you clear answers. Things just happen, and you’re left wondering what it all means. It can be confusing, but that’s also what makes it so compelling. The book makes you think, re-read passages, and even look up theories online just to piece things together. I personally really liked one on Reddit (contains spoilers): https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/12mqgkn/analysis_and_theory_about_kafka_on_the_shore/

If you’re someone who needs every question answered, this might be frustrating. But if you enjoy books that leave room for interpretation, this one will stick with you long after you’ve finished it. It’s the kind of book where you take your time, letting everything sink in.

“Kafka on the Shore” is a book to be savored. It’s strange, deep, and unpredictable, but that’s exactly what makes it special. It’s not just a story—it’s an experience. I’d say it’s best suited for readers who love books that make them think. I can’t wait to read it again.

Suitable for age (according to me): 18+
