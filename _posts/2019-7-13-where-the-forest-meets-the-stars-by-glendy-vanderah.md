 üå∫THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSüå∫ 

The story is based on the theme of colors.
It speaks of the importance of colors. We normally take such things (as the ability to see) for granted. This story makes us sympathize with those who can‚Äôt see clearly.

The story started like a ‚ÄúDora The Explorer‚Äù expedition to find something. Here it was 7 gifts of the 7 colors of a rainbow. 
I would have loved it more had it shown the description of Joshua‚Äôs understanding of colors in a better and a little more detailed way.

The focus was immediately shifted from colorful gifts to Joshua which decreased the value of gifts in the story.

Also, the grammar was bad at some place making it a fluency breaker in the reading process.

The story though predictable was a nice read.
I would recommend the book if you are looking for a short and fresh read.

Happy Reading!!
