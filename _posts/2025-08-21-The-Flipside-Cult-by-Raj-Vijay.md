### **Blurb:**
What if everything you consume is quietly consuming you? 

In a world spiraling into digital chaos and unchecked consumerism, one young genius builds an internet engine that dares to expose the truth behind modern life. The Flipside Cult follows Neil Sengupta—a BITS Pilani prodigy turned MIT rebel—who creates a tool that doesn’t just challenge the system, it mirrors it back to the people.

As the engine spreads across the nation like wildfire, it ignites public unrest, corporate backlash, and philosophical upheaval. Alongside three allies—each broken and brilliant in their own way—Neil’s invention forces society to confront a haunting question:

Have we traded our freedom for comfort? And if so, can we ever reclaim it?

Blending dystopian tension with emotional realism, The Flipside Cult is a bold literary debut that will make you rethink everything—from money and media to identity and morality. Perfect for readers of Yuval Noah Harari, Orwell, and fans of Black Mirror.

### **My Review:**
Raj Vijay’s “The Flipside Cult” is a bold and thought-provoking story that dives straight into the heart of our digitally saturated, consumer-driven world. The novel’s strength lies in its storytelling style as in its compelling story and razor-sharp plot, which constantly challenge the reader to reconsider the systems we live within.

At the center of the book is Neil Sengupta, a BITS Pilani prodigy who abandons the conventional path to create an internet engine — The Flipside Cult — that dares to reveal uncomfortable truths about society. Neil’s allies, each damaged yet brilliant, add another layer of intrigue. Their contrasting perspectives and fractured personal histories ensure that the story never slips into a simplistic battle of good versus evil. Instead, the plot operates in shades of gray, leaving space for the reader’s own interpretations.

The narrative escalates quickly as the cause spreads like wildfire. The book includes themes of corporate power, social unrest, and philosophical inquiry in ways that feel both urgent and unsettlingly real.

One of the most gripping elements is the courtroom drama, which brilliantly mirrors the real-world battles of technology versus ethics, innovation versus regulation, and truth versus comfort. These scenes are not just thrilling but also deeply reflective of our own times, forcing readers to draw parallels with current debates around consumerism.

For anyone interested in AI, sociology, or consumerism, this novel is a treasure. It’s perfect for readers who enjoy questioning the status quo. “The Flipside Cult” doesn’t just tell a story; it sparks a conversation that lingers long after the final page.

Suitable for age: 15+
