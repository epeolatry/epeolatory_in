### **Blurb:**
Six years ago, I had a best friend with sky-blue eyes, purposefully messy brown hair, and a body that made every single girl drool on sight. I would know—it drove me absolutely crazy…until I was the one doing the drooling.

Our days were filled with stomach-hurting laughter accompanied by easy conversation, and our nights were filled with secret, awkward teenage flirting.
But that was when Dawson was just my best friend. Nothing more, nothing less.

And then… it was more.

It’s a memory I pretend to see through blurry eyes, hazed by passing years of no communication. The one night that my heart was suddenly soaring through the starry night, only to catch fire as it rapidly descended seconds later.

Six years was a long time to get my heart under control. A lot has changed, and yet here I am, still drooling over Dawson—my ex best friend.

### **My Review:**
It is a typical teenage romance. Ivy and Dawson are best friends but deep inside they know they love each other more than just as best friends. They do not want to accept it because they are scared that they might lose their friendship as well.

The story is very innocent and characters cute.
Ivy is a strong girl. She has grown beyond her age because of the happenings that took place in her life.
Dawson though is a perfect lover but becomes quite obsessive about ivy sometimes. But it is cute.

I found the plot simple and predictable. But the writing style was good. It was funny and enjoyable.
But at various points I felt lack of emotions. The characters 'chuckled' and 'laughed' at serious moments, when they should have been crying or yelling at other. This took away the power of the scene and made it look bland.

I felt mixed emotions while reading the book. Sometimes I was laughing like a mad person while at other times I was literally yelling in my mind "Can you guys just stop laughing till you sort your issues?"

I would recommend it for a light mushy romance read. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
