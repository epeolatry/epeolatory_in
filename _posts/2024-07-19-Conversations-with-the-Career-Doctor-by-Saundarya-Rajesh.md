### **Blurb:**
India ranks among the bottom end of countries when it comes to women's participation in the workforce, as per research conducted by the International Labour Organization and other reputed institutions. Despite pushing gender inclusion to the forefront and making considerable progress, it is clear that Indian women don't have it easy today. Conversations with the Career Doctor is a ready-reckoner that women can refer to whenever they are confronted with a challenge. It provides a powerful toolkit for every Indian woman professional to lead a strong, secure and successful career.

Saundarya Rajesh, through these twenty-six stories, helps women navigate the loaded inequities in the ecosystem that is charged with social, familial and economic biases, and provides solutions to help them stay employed, make money, achieve financial security and keep bounding forward. Accessibly written, well-researched and keenly solution-oriented, this book is the perfect guide for every working woman.

### **My Review:**
Saundarya Rajesh’s “Conversations with the Career Doctor” is a compelling and essential read for anyone interested in learning more about the lives of women in the Indian workforce. 

The book contains around twenty-six narratives, each depicting the multifaceted challenges faced by Indian women in their professional journeys. The author’s storytelling is both engaging and enlightening, capturing the social, familial, and economic biases that women navigate daily. These stories are not just success stories or tales of struggle but are infused with practical, solution-oriented advice, making the book a powerful toolkit for any woman seeking to advance her career.

What sets “Conversations with the Career Doctor” apart is its balance of highlighting struggles and providing actionable steps. The author covers a wide range of topics, from pregnancy and career breaks to the challenges of being a housewife and the broader themes of feminism and mental health. This comprehensive approach ensures that the book addresses various aspects of a woman’s life, offering strategies to overcome obstacles and thrive in their career.

The book serves as a gentle reminder that women are not alone in their struggles and that success is achievable with the right tools and mindset. The author emphasizes the importance of skills development and having a supportive environment, underlining the crucial role of mental health in career success.

As a feminist, I found this book particularly resonant. It provides concrete evidence of the hurdles women face and counters the misconception that a few women in leadership signify equality. The book is not only a guide for women but also an eye-opener for men, making it a must-read for all.
