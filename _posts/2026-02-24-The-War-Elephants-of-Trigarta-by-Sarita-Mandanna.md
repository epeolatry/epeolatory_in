### **Blurb:**
326 BCE. The kingdom of Trigarta is ruled by Raja Puru. Young Mili, the spirited daughter of the general in charge of the war elephants, befriends a rare white elephant. She lovingly names him Nathu. Wild and untameable, Nathu refuses to obey anyone except Mili.

When the Greek Emperor Alexander’s army thunders towards India, storming through the northern borders, Raja Puru prepares for war. With Alexander’s eyes set on conquest and Raja Puru refusing to surrender, the two mighty armies clash on the banks of the ancient Vitasta River. Determined to do their part, Mili and Nathu join the battlefield.

Will Mili, and Trigarta’s lucky omen, Nathu, help turn the tide of the battle that will go down in history as the Battle of Hydaspes, and defeat Alexander the Great?

The War Elephants of Trigarta by Sarita Mandanna is a gripping tale of bravery, loyalty, and the extraordinary bond between a girl and her mischievous elephant. This book is part of the Bold Chronicles series, which brings Mandanna’s love of storytelling to younger readers. Spanning a period of 2,500 years, each tale is inspired by a real moment from India’s rich and layered history. At the heart of every adventure is an unlikely young hero or heroine who must summon courage, wit, and heart to make their way through extraordinary times.

### **My Review:**
“The War Elephants of Trigarta” by Sarita Mandanna is set during the Alexander–Puru war and follows Mili, the young daughter of a general in charge of war elephants, and her tender bond with a rare white elephant, Nathu.

What stood out most to me was the perspective. Instead of retelling the war through kings and conquests, the story unfolds through a child who is trying to make sense of politics, loyalty, and conflict around her. It offers a softer, more accessible lens into a historically heavy moment. The characters are warm and likeable, and Mili and Nathu’s relationship brings a gentle emotional core to the narrative.

That said, I didn’t find myself fully immersed in the book. While the premise is engaging and the storytelling is pleasant, I found myself struggling to finish it. Still, it is a delightful, especially for younger readers.

Suitable for age: 13+
