With time running out, he knows that he must switch to a new career — one that makes him happy. 
But, is 24 too late to do that? Is he making a mistake? 
Find out as Keith follows his heart in pursuit of an impossible-looking dream. 

### **My Review:**

The Big Switch is a story is about pursuing your dreams. It reminds us that it is never too late to follow your heart.
The story revolves around Keith, his life and his decision to pursue his dreams. Everyone else were merely supporting characters in his journey towards his goal.
The author could have diverted from the main plot and went on explaining all the aspects of the story of other characters as well, but he was able to keep the focus of the story intact.
Midway through the book, I thought that the decisions made by Keith were stupid and unrealistic, but it all started making sense over the course of story.
Author was truly the god of the characters, writing their fates. Now, you do not question God’s ways. Do you?
I love the character of Rahul. He is an amazing manager, a great leader, true friend and a determined supporter.
Writing style is great and easily relatable. Characterization is done well. There are no ‘villians’ in the story. Who needs a villian in their life, when their lives already suck!
The doubts in Keith’s mind are very real. Questioning your desires and your abilities is something very natural. He is confused, he is scared, but he is determined to make his dream come true.
If you are currently working you might get some great tips in the book (not only how to switch your profession, but also how to stick to the job while being able to maintain a work – life balance)
If you are a manager/leader you will know what TO BE and what NOT to be.
This book makes you realise the importance of having good friends, a role model, and a dream.
If you start working for thing you like to do, you’ll gradually find a way to reach a place where you are supposed to reach.
Very much recommended if you are feeling stuck somewhere in life.
