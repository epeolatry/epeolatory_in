You know that moment when you read a scene and suddenly your throat tightens, your chest aches, or you smile like the characters are your best friends? That’s the magic of authentic emotion in writing. It’s not about describing tears or shouting, it’s about making readers feel something real.

So how do you move past clichés and write emotional scenes that stick? Here are some tried-and-true tips:

### 1. Show, Don’t Announce
Avoid writing “She was sad” or “He was angry.” These labels tell the reader what the character feels but not how it feels. Instead, show us:
*She stared at the untouched coffee, fingers curled around the warm mug like a lifeline, eyes fixed on nothing.*
This gives your reader space to experience the emotion alongside the character, without spoon-feeding.

### 2. Ground It in the Body
Emotions live in the body. A racing heart, sweaty palms, a lump in the throat—these visceral clues help the reader connect instantly.
*His stomach twisted as if he’d swallowed broken glass.*
*Her voice came out tight, words clipped like she was holding them together with thread.*
Use physical reactions sparingly but powerfully; they anchor emotion in the moment.

### 3. Use Emotional Contrast
The most emotional moments often come from contrast: joy interrupted by grief, calm shattered by anger. A quiet build-up followed by an emotional release can hit harder than a dramatic outburst.
Think: The character who finally breaks down after pretending everything's fine for pages. That moment lands because of the buildup.

### 4. Stay True to Character
Not every character cries when sad or yells when angry. Know their personality, history, and emotional language. A stoic character’s silence might scream louder than a meltdown.
Ask: How would this character express hurt? Humor? Guilt? The more specific you are, the more real it feels.

### 5. Mine Real Experiences
You don’t have to recreate your trauma—but pulling from real emotional memory can help. Think of a time you felt something similar. What did your body do? What thoughts spiraled through your mind?
Even if the situation is different, the emotional texture can guide your writing.

Writing authentic emotion is less about dramatic language and more about emotional honesty. You don’t need perfect words; you need to tell the truth. Whether it’s heartbreak, jealousy, wonder, or quiet joy, let your characters feel fully. And if they do, your readers will too.
