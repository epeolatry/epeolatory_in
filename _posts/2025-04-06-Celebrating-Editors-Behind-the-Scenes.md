Today marks five years since I officially stepped into the world of book editing. It’s the kind of work that exists in the margins—literally and metaphorically. As editors, we don’t sign book jackets or feature in launch events. Our names rarely appear in the acknowledgments. But our fingerprints are all over the final pages that reach the reader.

Editing has taught me patience, empathy, and the delicate art of shaping someone else’s voice without leaving behind my own. It’s a job that requires you to be invisible and indispensable at the same time.

To celebrate this milestone, I want to acknowledge some of the editors behind my favorite books—those who worked quietly and brilliantly to bring powerful stories to life.

•	"The Night Circus" edited by Sophia Schoepfer
•	"The Time Traveler’s Wife" edited by Anika Streitfeld and David Poindexter
•	"The Midnight Library" edited by Haritha C. K.
•	"Eleanor & Park" edited by the team at St. Martin’s Griffin
•	"They Both Die at the End" edited by Brooks Sherman
•	"The Great Gatsby" edited by Maxwell Perkins
•	"The Namesake" edited by Alberto Vourvoulias-Bush
•	"A Fine Balance" edited by Doris Giller
•	"The God of Small Things" edited by Pankaj Mishra

Looking back, I’m inspired by these editors—some industry veterans, others less known—who helped shape books that have stayed with me for years. Their contributions remind me why I chose this path and why I remain in love with the process. Here’s to the editors—past, present, and future—who make great writing even greater. And here’s to the next chapter in this quiet, fulfilling journey.
