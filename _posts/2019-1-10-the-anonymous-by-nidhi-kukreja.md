### **Blurb:**
"As I sat down, my eyes rested on the envelope lying on the doormat, For Natasha, the writing on it said. I panicked, this cant is him again! I hurriedly opened it and his words made me cry out loud.” 
The Anonymous is the story of Natasha, a victim of sexual violence, assault, harassment, and rape, who was a happy, cheerful girl, but she is now cold, heartbroken and weak! During her recovery, she was dragged into a vicious cycle of nightmares by the letters, that just wouldn’t let her move on. 

“Dreams are woven and seamed when the bloodsheds” 

But the path we move on is always not easy; Hurdles, difficulties, issues, problems bring you down, but the inspiration and spirit to go ahead keep you focused and determined. It is not easy, sometimes we get lost and trapped. 

Is she trapped by it? Or is she forced into a cycle of self-harm and depression? Is it a fight to survive? Is there really no escaping the past? 

“Hello. Don’t put the book down just yet, pick it. You are welcome to my world.” - The Anonymous 

### **My Review:**
The story is very thoughtfully written. The writing style is sophisticated. The transitions from present to past are made very clearly.

The plight of a rape victim (read: survivor) was presented with such veracity that it makes the reader feel the pain of Natasha. 
The letters by The Anonymous cringes the reader as if they themselves have received it. You not only visualise the story, but somewhere in the journey become a part of their story. 

The characters were not perfect. No one is. And this is the best part of a book, where everyone's weaknesses and darksides are shown and worked upon throughout their journey.

The story talks about changes. How some incidents can change lives of people and people themselves. How a friend becomes stranger and strangers become your lifeline.

The simplicity of the story touched my heart and will remain there forever. 


### ***Happy Reading!!***
