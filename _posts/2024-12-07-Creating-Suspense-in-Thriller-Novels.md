Creating suspense and tension is crucial in thriller novels. It keeps readers on the edge of their seats, guessing and invested in the story. But, how do you create this suspenseful atmosphere in your writing? 

Here’s how you can add the spice of suspense in your writing.

**1. A Good Premise:**
To start, you need a strong premise. A good thriller begins with a compelling premise that sets the tone for the rest of the story. It should be clear and concise, and raise questions in the reader’s mind.

**2. Leave it unexplained:**
Next, use the unknown to your advantage. Leave some things unexplained or hinted at to create an air of mystery. This will keep readers engaged and curious. If you tell everything, there would be no shock value to the twists. 

**3. Know the Pace:**
Pacing is also crucial in creating suspense and tension. Vary your pacing. Fast-paced scenes can create a sense of urgency, while slower scenes can build anticipation. Don’t be afraid to subvert your readers’ expectations. This will keep them guessing and on their toes.

**4. Personify the Suspense:**
Your characters should be well-developed and relatable. This will make readers invested in their fate and worried about what might happen to them. Adding suspense would be easy if you add a character which has a mysterious aura. Don’t explain much about this character and bring it in at the most unexpected scenes. 

**5. The Environment:** 
It is also necessary to build the story’s environment around suspense. Creating the plot in a world that screams mystery is one of the best way to inculcate suspense in thrillers. While characters and other factors do help in creating suspense, environment is the easiest way to describe it.

By incorporating these techniques into your writing, you’ll be able to create a suspenseful atmosphere that will keep your readers engaged and invested in your story.
