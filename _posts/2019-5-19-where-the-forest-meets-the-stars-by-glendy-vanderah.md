 THE REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

#### Blurb: In this gorgeously stunning debut, a mysterious child teaches two strangers how to love and trust again.

After the loss of her mother and her own battle with breast cancer, Joanna Teale returns to her graduate research on nesting birds in rural Illinois, determined to prove that her recent hardships have not broken her. She throws herself into her work from dusk to dawn, until her solitary routine is disrupted by the appearance of a mysterious child who shows up at her cabin barefoot and covered in bruises.

The girl calls herself Ursa, and she claims to have been sent from the stars to witness five miracles. With concerns about the child’s home situation, Jo reluctantly agrees to let her stay—just until she learns more about Ursa’s past.

Jo enlists the help of her reclusive neighbor, Gabriel Nash, to solve the mystery of the charming child. But the more time they spend together, the more questions they have. How does a young girl not only read but understand Shakespeare? Why do good things keep happening in her presence? And why aren’t Jo and Gabe checking the missing children’s website anymore?

Though the three have formed an incredible bond, they know difficult choices must be made. As the summer nears an end and Ursa gets closer to her fifth miracle, her dangerous past closes in. When it finally catches up to them, all of their painful secrets will be forced into the open, and their fates will be left to the stars.

### My Review:

I loved the story. It is fresh and keeps you hooked since the beginning. 
The plot is great about a girl coming from stars and making good things happen to good people.
The writing style is brilliant and the story made me cry at more than one point.

As the story unfolds the past of all the characters is bought to light. The reader understands the characters and their decisions. 
It makes you believe in trust and love. It makes you believe that good things happen to good people.

The young girl, Ursa is wise beyond her years. She is smart and knows what she wants. She came looking for five miracles and with each miracle, she teaches us that life is full of wonders if you have an eye for it.

The title is very apt for the story. Jo works in the forest for her field study for research. So the forest plays a very important role in the story. Also, Ursa claims that she has come from stars. Hence that is another important aspect of the story. 
Where the Forest Meets the Stars, therefore, justifies the story.

I definitely recommend this book to everyone.

**Happy Reading!!**
