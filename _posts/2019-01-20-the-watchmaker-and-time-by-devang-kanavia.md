### **My Review:**
The Watchmaker and Time is a beautifully written story which talks about the philosophy of time and eternity. 

It enlightens us about the complicated questions about time while letting the reader ponder upon what the author has to say.

The story is written in a very simplistic manner which makes it easy to understand. It is a very touching story and leaves an impression on the reader for "ETERNITY".

It is a short read recommended for readers of all ages. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
