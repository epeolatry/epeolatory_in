### **Blurb:**
Lewis Cutterman is a well respected brain surgeon and happliy married with two beautiful children who run the family business. They are model citizens within the community. A simple visit to their home by a beautiful saleswoman is greeted by an invitation to dinner. But dinner takes a deadly turn when the woman finds herself drugged by the family. Waking up in a basement, strapped to an operating table, and surrounded by other prisoners of the Cutterman family, she quickly discovers that their captors intend to remove and sell their internal organs on the black market. And then to get rid of the evidence, they will all be slowly eaten, piece... by ... piece.

### **My Review:**
It is one of the most scary, dark, torturous  and egregious novels I have ever read.

Well I don't know if it should be called a good book or a bad one. Bad because it is so gross that you sometimes wish to drop it. And good because it comes up so graphically gross that you sometimes wish to drop it.

The book is very smartly written that you want to curse the characters and kill them and let them burn in hell.

Recommended if you can read it.

DARE: Watch the movie. (Though I haven't watched it but since the movie is directed by the author himself you can just imagine how hard he might have worked to create his vision.) 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
