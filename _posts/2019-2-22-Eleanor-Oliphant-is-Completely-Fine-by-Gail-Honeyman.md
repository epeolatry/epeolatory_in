### **Blurb:**
No one’s ever told Eleanor that life should be better than fine

Meet Eleanor Oliphant: she struggles with appropriate social skills and tends to say exactly what she’s thinking. Nothing is missing in her carefully timetabled life of avoiding unnecessary human contact, where weekends are punctuated by frozen pizza, vodka, and phone chats with Mummy. 

But everything changes when Eleanor meets Raymond, the bumbling and deeply unhygienic IT guy from her office. When she and Raymond together save Sammy, an elderly gentleman who has fallen, the three rescue one another from the lives of isolation that they had been living. Ultimately, it is Raymond’s big heart that will help Eleanor find the way to repair her own profoundly damaged one. If she does, she'll learn that she, too, is capable of finding friendship—and even love—after all.

Smart, warm, uplifting, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine is the story of an out-of-the-ordinary heroine whose deadpan weirdness and unconscious wit make for an irresistible journey as she realizes. . . 
the only way to survive is to open your heart.

### **My Review:**
Initially you find Eleanor a very dumb character. She is a thirty year something old woman who seems to have no idea of the world around her. She doesn't know the difference between a computer, a laptop and a tablet, when she herself is an finance clerk whose 9-5 job revolves around a computer screen.

But as the story unfolds you get to know about Eleanor's past bit by bit. You understand why she acts the way she do. You feel bad for her and for what she is going through.

Raymond comes as a light of hope in the dark and dull life of Eleanor. As they get more friendly, he realises that there is something wrong in Eleanor's life and does his best to make it better.

It is a heartbreaking story about a girl who has always been told that she is not good enough. It is a story of true friendship and relations which are thicker than blood. It is a story of a loner who realises that you need to surround yourself with the people who love you unconditionally.

The end takes an unpredictable turn making the reader take Eleanor's entire journey on a more serious note.

It is a beautifully written story which is heart touching and definitely makes you fall in love with its characters. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
