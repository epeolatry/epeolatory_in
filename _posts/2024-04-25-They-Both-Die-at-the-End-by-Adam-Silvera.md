### **Blurb:**
On September 5, a little after midnight, Death-Cast calls Mateo Torrez and Rufus Emeterio to give them some bad news: They’re going to die today.

Mateo and Rufus are total strangers, but, for different reasons, they’re both looking to make a new friend on their End Day. The good news: There’s an app for that. It’s called the Last Friend, and through it, Rufus and Mateo are about to meet up for one last great adventure—to live a lifetime in a single day.

Adam Silvera reminds us that there’s no life without death and no love without loss in this devastating yet uplifting story about two people whose lives change over the course of one unforgettable day.

### **My Review:**
"They Both Die at the End" by Adam Silvera is a heart-wrenching tale shares the message of of living life to the fullest, even in the face of imminent death. 

What stands out about Silvera's narrative is its deliberate pacing. The plot unfolds slowly, but purposefully, mirroring the fleeting nature of time for the protagonists. Knowing the inevitable conclusion from the outset, the focus of the storytelling is on the profound experiences condensed into a single day. The simplicity of the writing style enhances the emotional impact, making the story accessible yet deeply affecting.

One of the novel's strengths is its character development. The characters of Mateo and Rufus undergo transformative arcs, each leaving an indelible mark on the other amidst the backdrop of impending doom. While Mateo and Rufus serve as the central figures, Silvera ensures that supporting characters receive their due through separate chapters. This provides the readers with insight into the lives and motivations of those touched by Mateo and Rufus. It adds depth to the story, emphasizing the interconnectedness of lives even in brief encounters.

The thematic core of the book revolves around the fragility of life and the importance of human connection. Silvera deftly explores profound topics like love, loss, and friendship within the confined timeframe of a day. The message to seize every moment and cherish relationships resonates powerfully, amplified by the imminent end awaiting the characters.

The emotional resonance of "They Both Die at the End" is undeniable. Readers are compelled to ponder their own mortality and consider what they might do if confronted with a similar fate. Silvera's narrative underscores the importance of living authentically and embracing life's fleeting moments.

I would highly recommend "They Both Die at the End" to anyone looking for an emotional read and wanting to rebuild their connection with life.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
