### **Blurb:**
Framed in the doorway of Poirot’s bedroom stood an uninvited guest, coated from head to foot in dust. The man’s gaunt face stared for a moment, then he swayed and fell. Who was he? Was he suffering from shock or just exhaustion? Above all, what was the significance of the figure 4, scribbled over and over again on a sheet of paper? We follow Hercule Poirot as he finds himself plunged into a world of international intrigue, risking his life to uncover the truth about ‘Number Four’. 

### **My Review:**
While Agatha Christie’s cosy mystery novels often unfold within the confines of a limited setting—a country house, a ship, a train—“The Big Four” shatters those expectations by taking readers on a transcontinental journey, spanning America, London, and France. Even the timeline stretches over several months.

The plot of “The Big Four” bursts with twists and turns that leave the reader constantly guessing. Unlike a single, linear investigation, this novel is peppered with mini-quests that create a mosaic of suspense and intrigue. Each chapter brings a new surprise, ensuring that readers remain engaged and on edge, wondering what new challenge Hercule Poirot will face next.

I learned later that the book was published as a serialized fiction, with each chapter initially intended to be standalone. Understanding this context casts the story in a new light, adding an appreciation for Agatha Christie’s skill in weaving disparate chapters into a cohesive narrative. Despite the novel’s serialized roots, Agatha Christie’s craftsmanship shines through, and the plot holds together remarkably well.

Poirot, as always, is a paragon of wit and brilliance, who thinks way beyond what our “little grey cells” could fathom. Arthur Hastings’ unwavering loyalty and endearing simplicity make him the perfect companion, adding warmth and camaraderie to the story. The supporting characters also leave a lasting impact, each contributing to the narrative’s depth.

Ultimately, “The Big Four” is a testament to Agatha Christie’s ability to captivate readers. For anyone looking to experience Poirot in an international setting full of unpredictable challenges, “The Big Four” is a must-read.
