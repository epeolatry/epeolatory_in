### **Blurb:**
So often as leaders we look for solutions outside of ourselves or our teams, hoping it is better than what we can come up with. Sometimes when we find none, we give up. We give up on the pure potentiality of how we can improve things ourselves. With World Economic Forum Global Risks Reports looking bleaker year-on-year, with more interconnected risks than ever, it is time to turn inward and take grounded action with all that we have instead. This book provides an approach called dignity. It is a seven step creative problem-solving process that believes answers to our complex wicked problems are within and around us. We just need to work better, together. Visit www.goalweaver.biz for more information.
