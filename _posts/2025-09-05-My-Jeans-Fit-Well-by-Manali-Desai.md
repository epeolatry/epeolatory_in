### **Blurb:**
Think The Book of Awesome meets a pocket-sized daydream.

Does popping bubble wraps satisfy you? When you spot a rainbow, or catch a beautiful sunset, what do you feel? We spend our lives chasing (and sometimes failing to find) happiness not realizing that it's hiding in plain sight - tucked behind a perfectly timed comeback, or waiting in the first bite of a favorite dish after a long time. Maybe it arrives with a good hair day that matches your plans, or grins back through a bookish friend you didn’t know you needed. This collection is your invitation to slow down, smile more, and reconnect with the little delights stashed away amidst life’s routines.

My Jeans Fit Well & The Ice-Cream Didn't Melt, is a collection of 150+ such nuggets, paired with whimsical illustrations that are slices of happiness with a gentle reminder that joy doesn’t need grand gestures; sometimes, it’s the little things that lift us the most.

This book asks you to pause and perhaps even find your own relatable, or newfound everyday joys. Perfect for anyone who loves a good list, a good laugh, and the good kind of goosebumps.

If you’ve ever smiled at a perfect sunset or laughed at a silly pun, this book is your happy place.

### **My Review:**
My Jeans Fit Well & The Ice-Cream Didn’t Melt is the kind of book that instantly makes you smile even before you’ve flipped through more than a few pages. It’s filled with adorable illustrations that perfectly capture those small but oh-so-satisfying joys we often overlook. From popping bubble wrap to catching a rainbow at the right time, each page feels like a gentle reminder to pause and appreciate life’s tiny victories.

What I love most is how realistic the situations are. These aren’t grand, once-in-a-lifetime moments—it’s the jeans fitting just right, the ice cream surviving the walk home, or stumbling upon an old note tucked away. Things we’ve all experienced but rarely take the time to celebrate. That makes the book feel almost like a personal journal, one that tracks little bursts of fun and gratitude we’d all like to hold on to.

It’s very creative in its simplicity, very personal in tone, and above all, very relatable. Honestly, reading it feels like chatting with a goofy friend who sees the world with wonder. If you’re looking for something light, cheerful, and heartwarming, this pocket-sized collection might just become your happy place.

Suitable for age: 13+
