### **Blurb:**
We know how rife India is with study pressure and competition. Dhanya has low marks in school. Her teacher says she needs to ‘work harder’. In other words, she’s ‘too stupid to compete’. Dhanya protests against this assessment. She says school is useless, so she doesn’t try. It’s a lie to say that she’s not capable.

### **My Review:**
In "The 'Stupid' Child's First Rank Effort" by Kunal Roy, the narrative unfolds with the 14-year-old protagonist, Dhanya, facing academic challenges. She feels frustrated when urged to work harder by teachers because she believes she is not stupid. She just does not care about the school curriculum as it is “not practical”, particularly subjects like Maths and Science. 

The theme of the story intrigued me, given my own experiences with competition in school. I approached the narrative hoping to discover insights on handling competition or to cheer for Dhanya as she navigated her path to success.

The author's attempt to compare education with learning magical mantras falls short, as the story struggles to convincingly portray the practical value of the acquired skills. The description of the new school as “a place for facing the real world” contradicts the fantastical nature of battling elemental forces with mantras, lacking real-world applicability.

The narrative justifies rote learning in the new school as the mantras are collections of complicated phrases even when Dhanya uses her intellect to understand the mantras' etymology. Her choices can be called a child’s tantrums. How they would work hard for something they like, but won’t give any amount of effort for something they don’t like.

The inciting action lacks a compelling motivation or conflict. Dialogues lack flow, hindering reader engagement with the characters and the plot. I like the gradual development of the plot and the introduction of the mystery character, but the story is not able to provide clarity about its role.

The sexually suggestive scenes were unnecessary. (The story was initially marked for an audience of 10+, which has now been removed after I raised the issue with the publisher.) Although not quite explicit, these scenes don’t add any value to the characters or the story. They are introduced and brushed off. 

Despite these critiques, the book cover and title effectively convey the theme of the protagonist rebelling against traditional education. I commend the author for addressing important themes such as hard work, understanding over learning, respecting animals, and that respect is given and taken. He delivers a well-intentioned message about a child's excuses and interests. However, the book requires improvement in maintaining an appropriate tone, elevating the stakes for the main character, and refining the narration. 

While I didn't find the book as enjoyable as I hoped, it might resonate with a different audience. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
