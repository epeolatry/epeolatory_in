### **Blurb:**
HOW LONG CAN YOU KEEP YOUR FAITH IF YOU WERE TRAPPED FOREVER?

Manjiri, a devout atheist, is meeting her friend Manu after 20 years. Their conversation soon turns into an argument over God's existence, and its nature. What seemed to be a harmless debate becomes Manjiri's worst nightmare when she is trapped by Manu in a cell. Are Manu's intentions malign or is this some weird test of faith? Take a seat, buckle your belt, as you set yourself on the world's most claustrophobic, yet enlightening, journey of Manjiri. Be prepared to see life in a radically different way with this bold, edge of the seat thriller.

### **My Review:**
Faith's Eternal Sunshine is an interesting story that questions the existence of God but also explains the existence of a Higher Power. It preaches faith rather than religion.

The story is a much more practical and realistic version of "The Secrets" by Rhonda Byrne.

Faith's Eternal Sunshine teaches us the following lesson through the medium of a story of Manjiri and Manu.

1) Happiness comes with pain

You can never savour the taste of happiness until you have tasted pain. Seeing the pain of others we realise how fortunate we are for not being in that situation.

2) Certainity of death makes relationships stronger.

If I knew someone is immortal and will stay as it is forever, I will start getting envious of it. Our relationship will start degrading to an extent that I will have nothing but hatred for that person.

3) Death is end. But endings are beautiful.

"Life is good with all its colours, black and white, joys and sorrows, but until the artwork is finished no one applauds. Death was that final stroke on canvas."

4) Have faith in the Higher Power.

Believe in the existence of that power from the core of your heart. You need to realise that the Higher Power wants your well being and everything happens for a reason. Be grateful for every little thing you have in your life.

5) Miracle happens

"The truth is that miracles are mostly small, sometimes so infinitely small that they pass unobserved. A miracle could be as small as triggering something that may not fulfil the wish of a believer but makes them stronger in the path of fulfilling that wish."

(And I believe it because I have experienced it personally.)

Checkout the story of miracle in my life here:

Do miracles happen? by Falguni Jain

There are a lot of learnings in this novel. Every sentence has a deeper meaning which has to be read, understood and applied to one's life.

There were some grammatical errors, otherwise it no doubt deserves a 5-on-5 rating.

I definitely recommend this book to everyone. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
