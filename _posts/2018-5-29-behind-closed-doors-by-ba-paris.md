### **Blurb:**

Everyone knows a couple like Jack and Grace: he has looks and wealth, she has charm and elegance. You'd like to get to know Grace better. But it's difficult, because you realize Jack and Grace are never apart. Some might call this true love.

Picture this: a dinner party at their perfect home, the conversation and wine flowing. They appear to be in their element while entertaining. And Grace's friends are eager to reciprocate with lunch the following week. Grace wants to go, but knows she never will. Her friends call—so why doesn't Grace ever answer the phone? And how can she cook such elaborate meals but remain so slim?

And why are there bars on one of the bedroom windows?

The perfect marriage? Or the perfect lie?

### **My Review:**

What if a perfect looking marriage is actually a perfect lie.

The story is about Jack and Grace who are known as the perfect couple amongst their friends. But what happens behind closed doors is something no one can imagine.

Jack is a brilliant lawyer who defends battered women. He plays a perfect host in social gatherings. He apparenptly loves his wife, Grace and her sister, Millie, who is suffering from downs syndrome

I love Grace, Millie and Esther. They are smart, intelligent and aware of everything happening around them.

Grace although has lived in a torturous environment for almost an year, has been able to maintain sanity of her mind.

Millie is wiser than what people think. She knows that her sister, Grace is in a problem and tries to help her.

Esther is smart. She doesn’t takes up thing as they are. She have a curious mind and a kind heart.

Jack’s character was a bit bland. Making him villian just for the sake of it. A little more work could be done on developing his character.

However I read this book in a day. It was so engaging that I was hooked to it since the first page. The first time I looked up from the novel, I realised I have already completed 50% of it.

I read the last chapter thrice in a hope that their would be something more to it. I couldn’t believe that it got over just yet. I wished it could go on for a while.

Nevertheless, it is a dark, disturbing novel. And I would definitely recommend it to you if psychological thriller is your genre.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
