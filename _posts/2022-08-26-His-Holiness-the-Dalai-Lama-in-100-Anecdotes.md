### **Blurb:**
An accessible introduction for young people to the Dalai Lama.

On July 6, 1935, a mischievous boy was born in a remote village in Tibet, who, at the age of two, was recognized as the fourteenth reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. His eventful boyhood in Lhasa, thrilling escape to India and subsequent exile in Dharamsala, captured the imagination of thousands. With an endearing smile and childish humor, he has become a symbol of optimism and hope for the oppressed.

Tracing his life through 100 lesser-known and inspiring incidents, unusual trivia, and gorgeous illustrations, this one-of-a-kind book explores the Dalai Lama's vision, teachings, and philosophies. His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 100 Anecdotes is a classic tribute and a collectible edition that celebrates the various facets of an extraordinary spiritual leader from his birth through his eighty-seventh birthday.


### **My Review:**
We have always heard about His Holiness the Dalai Lama, but how much do we know about him? 

"His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 100 Anecdotes" is a truly remarkable collection of unknown incidents and trivia that takes the reader through his journey right from his childhood to this date. Each one-page anecdote is short, concise, and easy to read. The anecdotes provide a wonderful introduction to the Dalai Lama and his life and experiences. Most of the stories are really touching and entertaining. They are presented in a very engaging manner, which makes the reader want to read more and more. This book is a must-read for all those who want to know about him, his life, and his philosophies.

What I loved about this book is that it talks about some of the lesser-known events of his life, which is pretty interesting. I have learned so many interesting facts about the Dalai Lama and his journey. Like how he was chosen to become the 14th Dalai Lama, that he has been living in India since 1956, and of course, about the pictusque locations of Tibet and India that he visited. 

This book has given me a new perspective on the life of the Dalai Lama. It is an easy and fun read, which will leave you inspired. Each page is an inspiring anecdote that you can relate to, especially in your own journeys. Whether it's about following your interests or passion, staying calm in testing as well as happy times, or dealing with troubles. The book has given me a new way of looking at my own life and given me insights for becoming a better person.

The book also contains beautiful illustrations. And the burgundy red colour of the book, which is the color worn by the Buddhist monks, make the book visually appealing. 

I would highly recommend reading this book!

### ***Happy Reading!!***
