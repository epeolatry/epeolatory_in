### **Blurb:**
Dear reader,

I wrote this book for the ones who feel everything too deeply. The rare souls who still listen to their hearts and believe in love. The ones who don’t hurt others just because they’re in pain. The ones who wear their hearts on their sleeves and carry kindness within. The ones who overthink, over-invest in people and over-love, always.

This book is an ocean full of feelings, so if at any point, you feel like you’re drowning, take a moment to remind yourself that it’s a privilege to feel emotions as intensely as you do. Some people are so disconnected from their hearts that they don’t allow themselves to feel anything at all.

That being said, I wish you a happy reading. This book will make you cry.

Love,
Rithvik

### **My Review:**
> I think flowers
have cursed us humans, 
for they knew if we found 
the kind of love they have—
the way the rain loves them,
the way the sun holds them,
the way the water wants them to grow— 
if someone loved us enough
to never break our hearts too, 
we'd bloom so bright 
nobody would find flowers pretty anymore.

“Thank You for Leaving” by Rithvik Singh is a collection of poetry and prose about love, heartbreak, hope, relationships, family, friendships—and honestly, everything in between.

Right at the beginning, the author promises that the book will make you cry. I don't know about everyone else, but I definitely did.

What makes this collection special is that it doesn’t just talk about romantic breakups. It dives into heartbreaks caused by friends, by parents, even ourselves—just heartbreaks in general. The kind that shape you in small, quiet ways.

There’s this idea floating around that if you haven’t been in a relationship, it’s still a red flag, it’s still emotional baggage. I think there's some truth to that.

When you’re no longer excited about your birthday, or when you stop overthinking why someone hasn’t replied, or you say goodbye without tears in your eyes—there’s something there. That quiet numbness. I don’t think you need to go through a romantic heartbreak to feel that way.

The author beautifully expresses what love should feel like, what heartbreaks have felt like, and ultimately leaves you with a gentle sense of hope. He reminds us of the peace rain can bring, of the kind of love we should strive for, and the kind of person we should become.

The book feels like a collection of raw thoughts and emotions—like someone scribbled down whatever they were feeling on an ordinary day. It feels personal, even familiar. The writing is super simple and casual—mostly quotes, poems, and mini-prose pieces that are deeply relatable. 

The cover is this gorgeous shade of yellow—it feels warm, comforting, hopeful. But the sprayed edges were a bit too much for me. The neon yellow looks like a highlighter exploded. It works well with the cover aesthetically, but it distracted me while reading.

Still, “Thank You for Leaving” ends on a positive, comforting note. It tells you that the people who left were meant to go. That you don’t need toxic energy in your life. And that everyone you meet is part of your growth, shaping who you are and who you're becoming.

What I really took away was this: I'm grateful for everyone who’s come into my life—but I’m even more grateful for those who’ve left. Because they made space for better things to come.

It’s a light, pick-up-anytime kind of read. Flip to any page and you’ll find something to hold on to—something that reminds you you're not alone, and maybe, just maybe, gives you a little hope.

Suitable for age: 15+
