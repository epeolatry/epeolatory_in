### **Blurb:**
जीवन के सरल, सहज किन्तु गहरे अनुभव जब इतनी प्रामाणिकता से कहे जाएं कि उन्हें अस्वीकार करना संभव ही न हो, जब कहे हुए शब्दों और व्यक्तिगत अनुभवों में कोई अंतर शेष ना रहे तो ऐसे शब्दों का, ऐसी अभिव्यक्तियों का असर एक लम्बे समय तक रहता है। ये संग्रह ऐसी ही अभिव्यक्तियों का एक अनूठा संकलन हैं। सत्य- भिन्न-भिन्न रूपों में अभिव्यक्त होता, खरा, कड़वा किन्तु प्रामाणिक।

### **My Review:**
Baghishayar presents to the readers the simple realities of life in the simplest possible manner. On each page, a few lines of poetry are followed by the writer's comment or explantation.

He starts by talking about himself. Then he takes the readers through his life, his incomplete love and his break up, tells us the importance of friends and family,talks about dreams, and discusses the bitter truths of life. Each part of the book is relatable and easily resonates with the reader.

This book is made into a cute square shape and the cover picture is relevant to the topics written about. The cover is poised and so is the poetry inside.

It is a soothing and easy read. Despite me not usually reading Hindi books, this one was very easy to get into and understand.

It is a very quick read and can be finished in less than an hour.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
