### **Reviews:**

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - "Falguni Jain's "The Wheel of Fortune"is incredibly powerful because of the intense emotions it evokes in readers. The writing style is very subtle, which does complete justice to this novella.
I just loved the Book Cover, isn't it attractive?
I really liked how without any drama and exaggeration the story concludes. That is due to the author's sheer writing skills." - *Sakshi Nair*

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - "I liked the story as it was fresh and something unique. The story also gave a message about our thoughts how it impacts our way of life." - *Meraj*

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - "This is so perfect for my small attention spanüò≠ perfect. üíó" - *Amazon Customer*

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - "I read it at 2am and can't leave untill i complete it. I love this short story. And the ending was very good and impressive and 100% true. I am agree with the author what she is trying to tell us. Don't try to find short cuts in ur life work hard and u can achieve anything. Your body respond to what your brain want it to do. So think positive and results will be positive. " - *Habiba Khalid*

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - "I liked the way author kept it simple and intresting. As I said it's a short story so if i start telling you about it more i might end up giving the exact information, and i am pretty sure that's not what my wheel of fortune predicted today." - *Rashmi Shetty*
