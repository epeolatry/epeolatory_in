Short stories are able to capture readers’ attention in an instant by telling powerful stories succinctly and precisely. 

A short story is a focused narrative centred around a single event, character, or idea, with a straightforward plot and character development. It often features a twist ending or epiphany, leaving a lasting impression on the reader. Characters are explored quickly and impactful, with concise descriptions and dialogue. Some stories may use flashbacks or non-linear techniques to enhance the narrative.

Because of their themes, styles, and universal messages, a number of well-known short stories have made a lasting impact on literature and culture. These stories have even gone on to become iconic. 

Here are some of the most well-known short stories, along with the explanations for their recognition.

**4. “The Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka (1915)**

Because of its impact and brief length, Kafka’s “The Metamorphosis”, despite being regarded as a novella, is often discussed in the context of short stories. The bizarre premise of the story—Gregor Samsa, a travelling salesman, wakes up one morning to discover that he has changed into a gigantic insect—is what makes it so famous. “The Metamorphosis” is considered a foundational work of existential literature due to Kafka’s examination of alienation, identity, and the absurdity of life. The tale has had a huge impact on contemporary literature and has been the subject of innumerable interpretations and adaptations.

**5. “The Yellow Wallpaper” by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1892)**

“The Yellow Wallpaper” is acclaimed for its potent indictment of how women’s mental health was handled in the 1800s. The narrative is told through the journal entries of a woman whose husband has kept her confined to a room while she gets treatment for a “nervous condition”. As the narrative goes on, the narrator loses consciousness and becomes fixated on the room’s wallpaper. Gilman’s account is a foundational piece of feminist literature that emphasizes the larger problem of women’s autonomy as well as the oppressive nature of the medical care given to women at the time.
