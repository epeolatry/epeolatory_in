I have a confession!

In the past 1–1.5 years, I have used AI extensively for my posts, from ideating to research to content generation, but now is the time to change it.

When AI entered the scene, a majority of social media posts started recommending using it to make content within minutes. Showing how to use prompts and how to get the right output. But, no matter what I did, the results were the same — a dull, monotonous piece of content that I didn’t care to read before uploading, and neither did the audience.

Don’t get me wrong, there were some pros of using AI:
• It did make my work easier. Finding post ideas, getting ready-to-post content, and just minor polishing needed.
• Kept me consistent in posting. 3 times a week, for 10 months straight.
• Relevant content for my feed.

But, behind each pro, was a con:
• I went for easy and lost touch with the art of observation on the way.
• The posts were consistent, but lacked depth. The content sounded too monotonous. After 10 months, I felt burned out because I couldn’t think of new ideas.
• The content seemed relevant to me but didn’t have any personal insights for the audience.

So, here I am. Ready to start the new year with a more mindful approach towards social media. Focus is not on quantity, a little on quality, but mostly on sharing my thoughts and reclaiming my feed from the AI tone.
