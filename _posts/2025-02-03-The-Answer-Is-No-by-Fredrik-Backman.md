### **Blurb:**
Lucas knows the perfect night entails just three things: video games, wine, and pad thai. Peanuts are a must! Other people? Not so much. Why complicate things when he’s happy alone?

Then one day the apartment board, a vexing trio of authority, rings his doorbell. And Lucas’s solitude takes a startling hike. They demand to see his frying pan. Someone left one next to the recycling room overnight, and instead of removing the errant object, as Lucas suggests, they insist on finding the guilty party. But their plan backfires. Colossally.

Told in Fredrik Backman’s singular witty style with sharply drawn characters and relatable antics, “The Answer Is No” is a laugh-out-loud portrait of a man struggling to keep to himself in a world that won’t leave him alone.

### **My Review:**
Fredrik Backman strikes gold again with “The Answer Is No”, a short and hilarious story packed with sharp social commentary. The author’s trademark humor shines as he finds comedy in the everyday chaos of the protagonist’s life. It’s witty, relatable, and manages to tackle some serious issues without losing its lighthearted charm.

The author addresses materialism, herd mentality, and the way women’s labor often goes unappreciated, all while poking fun at incompetent board members of society and nosy neighbors. It’s the kind of story where you’ll laugh out loud one moment and nod thoughtfully the next.

Whether you’re in the mood for some laughs or just need a break from heavier reads, “The Answer Is No” is a delightful pick. And the best part? It’s free on Kindle and Audible for Prime members, so there’s no reason not to give it a go. The author proves yet again that he can blend humor with poignant insights, leaving you entertained and thinking long after you’re done. Definitely worth your time!

### ***Happy Reading!!***
