### **Blurb:**

Backpacking with her high school friends, Erica Lindell's life takes a thrilling new turn. Meeting the fascinating Sasha Ailes, she can't help but fall completely and irrevocably in love with him. When he feels the same way about her, Erica finds herself drawn into a fairytale love story that will set her life on a new direction. But Sasha has kept his true identity a secret. Finding out who he really is, Erica must overcome the betrayal and make the hardest choice of her life. Can she give up her own dreams to live in his world, or leave and lose him forever?

First Came Forever is an enchanting, heart-wrenching story about finding true love and the devastating consequences it can lead to. What price is too high to pay, even for love?

### **My Review:**

I really loved the book except for some typos.

The relationship of Erica and Shasha is beautifully described. And not only that, I also loved the way how the LGBTQ has been represented in the story.

Initially I didn't really think that I would enjoy the book because I am not really into romantic or young adult genre. I found it rather slow paced and skipped lot of paragraphs.
But to my surprise I was so hooked to it by the end that I couldn't believe the book was over just yet. It finished on a cliffhanger and now I can't wait for the release of 2nd part of the series.

(Well the second book releases on 18th June, 2018.) 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
