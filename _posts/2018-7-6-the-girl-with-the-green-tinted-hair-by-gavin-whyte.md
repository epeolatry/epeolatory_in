### **Blurb:**

There is a season for everything. 

Described as, "Moving", "Uplifting", and "Enlightening", The Girl with the Green-Tinted Hair is a spiritual fable about personal growth and about seeing how truly magical life is. 

When a boy finds a girl singing and dancing under his favourite tree he didn't realise he had been chosen to be the one-off witness to something out of this world. The boy is shown how to live in joy and is reminded of how to pursue his life's calling. His fear of ageing is overcome and dying is no longer what it seems - all because of the girl with the green-tinted hair. 

In this truly comforting tale of wonder and intrigue, which has been called a "hidden gem", we discover for ourselves how to live in harmony with that which is forever flowing; that which we call life. (

### **My Review:**

The Girl With Green Tinted Hair is a beautiful and one of the sweetest story I have ever read. After reading the title I was very much expecting it to be a thriller like Girl on the Train, Gone Girl, Girl behind the Glass etc. This is what "The Girl" in the title gives you away with the idea of book. 

But I was surprised to see what the book had in store instead.

The story isdivided into 4 chapters which are basically the four seasons in an year - Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. The writer has very cleverly related a tree in every season to the lifecycle of a human. Spring devotes childhood, summer devotes teenage. Autumn has been related to adulthood while winter to old age. 

The story seems like a song, with every word it touches your heart. I couldn't have enough of the life lessons shared artfully throughout the story.

I definitely recommend this book to everyone, from all age groups. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
