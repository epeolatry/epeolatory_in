### **My Review:**
"Alexandrian Knights" by Lavik Jain is a delightful tale that captures the imagination of young readers with its blend of adventure, magic, and friendship. The story follows four friends—Alex, Mike, Max, and Felix—on an exciting journey in the mysterious village of Kuldhara, Rajasthan. Their discovery of a secret temple and transformation into Elemental Knights sets the stage for a series of captivating puzzles and battles, culminating in a showdown with the sinister Shadow Lord.

The eight-year-old author exhibits remarkable creativity and storytelling prowess. The narrative is engaging, and the themes of bravery and camaraderie are woven into the plot. The vivid illustrations further enhance the reading experience, bringing the characters and settings to life.

However, the story does have its flaws. Some plot holes and gaps suggest that the author could have benefited from more guidance during the writing process. Addressing these issues would have strengthened the narrative and provided a smoother reading experience.

Overall, "Alexandrian Knights" is a commendable effort that showcases the potential of a young author. I am keen to read more of his works.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
