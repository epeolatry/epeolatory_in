### **Blurb:**
Two Girls In Love is the story of a young, Indian woman, written in the form of poetic diary entries. It follows her journey from the moment she realizes that she's free to be with whomever she wants to be with and that no law would stop her anymore.

Two Girls In Love is short, like a few pages torn out of someone's diary. But it tells a heartwarming tale of being true to yourself in a place where the people still may not be ready to accept you for who you are.

It's a story of hope, of love, of true friendships...it's the story of two girls who are so in love with each other.

### **My Review:**
"Two Girls in Love" is a story of girl, who introduces the readers to her sexuality, in form of poetic diary entries. The diary entry starts from the day when article 377 was struck down in India, giving LGBTQ community their well deserved rights.

The writing style is simple and decent. The protagonist's confusion about her own sexuality, the fear and the sense of freedom are all cleary shown.

I really enjoyed the shortness and the crispness of the story. It was to the point and kept up my interest till the last word.

Definitely recommended for a short and powerful read.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
