### **Blurb:**
Meet Siddhartha, a good lawyer but a bad human.

Meet Rahul, a good human but a bad doctor.

And meet Shuchi, a good human and an exceptionally well doctor.

Shuchi tries to make a good human out of Siddhartha and a good doctor out of Rahul, but a bomb blast transforms their lives.

Read this revolutionary tale to know how Siddhartha will get a unique PIL passed in the courtroom and Rahul will perform a life changing surgery, to save the girl they love.

### **My Review:**
Take my heart, forever is a beautifully written, and simple story involving realistic characters. 
It takes us through one of the most horrific incidents faced by India - the Mumbai bomb blast. The author takes the reader on an emotional journey of poor medical condition of India, injustice by the hands of the rich and powerful, and terrorism.

The story is definitely heart touching and makes the reader beg for a reform in our country. 

We want powerful and smart lawyers like Siddhartha given that they fight not for money but for the righteousness.
We want doctors like Shuchi who devote themselves selflessly for treatment of the underprivileged.
We want humans like Rahul who can restore humanity in the world.

There is a lot to be learned from this story, a lot to work upon for the betterment of our country, and a lot to be disccused and debated amongst the citizens but gradually accepted and implemented.

I highly recommend this novel to the readers from all walks of life.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
