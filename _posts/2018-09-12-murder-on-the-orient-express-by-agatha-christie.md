### **Blurb:**
Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.

Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again. 

### **My Review:**
This one was my first Agatha Christie read. I have always been excited to read this book and it didn’t disappoint.

Although the book has been written almost a century ago, but it is still equally enticing.

A train, a murder, a lot of suspects, all having watertight alibis. Then how did the murder take place under the most impossible conditions?

The story has a strong plot. Although there are a lot of characters, yet each is clearly identifiable. The author has been successful in maintaining suspense till the end. There are a lot of twists which keeps you hooked.

The writing style of Agatha Christie is very clever. It makes you feel like a detective and you try to solve the mystery as one. But you can’t beat Hercule Poirot!

If you love to read suspense and mystery, then this one is definitely one of the best recommendations for you. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
