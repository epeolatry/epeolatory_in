### **Blurb:**
A working mom, a US-aspirant son, an army colonel as dad and all the love it takes to keep a family together. Read this beautiful short story of mother-son relationship during contemporary times.

Also included is a tribute to the concluding chapters of an acclaimed fantasy-drama-series in television of the twenty-tens. 

### **My Review:**
The Farewell is a short story about family relations nowadays. It is a story of mutual feeling of how we love each other, but we are shy to show it.

It is quite real. Today's young generation have their goals and ambitions. People tend to believe that our goals are more important to us than our family. But it is not true. We just have different goals, different vision than our parents had years ago. That doesn't mean that our love and respect for our elders is any less. We want to reach the sky but we also know the importance of keeping our feet on the ground.

I feel our generation is very much misunderstood. 
Our spontaneity does not mean that we are rude, it just means that we are aware. 
Our plans to go abroad for studies or just to live away from our family, doesn't mean that we don't love them; it just means that we want to be independent. We don't want to bother our parents for every little thing. 
Our idea of settling down is not to get married and have kids. It is to earn enough to give ourselves and our family a much better and comfortable life.

I love the way Debjeet Mukherjee has been able to present this basic emotion in the simplest way.
