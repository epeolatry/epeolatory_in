### **Blurb:**
Pariniti is a young woman, a mother and a wife who used to be always tied up with her household chores. Amid lockdown she planned to transform her life by intense meditation. She was aware of the benefits of meditation but had no previous experience. All she knew was that meditation brings peace, happiness and abundance in life. As she couldn't go outside, meet her friends or do anything, she planned to go inside and explore her path of life. She wanted to connect with the universe and know all about her reasons for incarnation. When she started her journey, she was not able to do it much but with time she improved. With her journey of meditation, not only did she get peace and happiness, she realised how magical this journey is. She unlocked all the inner realms of the human body. 

She learned how the universe can help you live a good life. She learned how the conscience can travel through time and came to know about her past life and reason for her incarnation. She learned how she can be strong like a tree in any weather and how she can utilize her time more effectively and still absorb energy from five elements of the universe. She also learned how the universe has gifted everyone 7 to 9 different gifts. Read this book to know more about her journey & how she unlocked these gifts.

### **My Review:**
In my school, we were taught about the importance of pranayama, yoga, and hand mudras. But like any other student, I hardly paid any heed to the compulsory boringness of 30-40 minutes. However, lately, I have been very much captivated by the topic of spirituality and the Higher Power. 

*The Mystery Within You* is one such book that intrigues you to know what your inner self is capable of doing. The book takes the reader on Pariniti's journey where she finds the blocks in her life and heals herself with the help of meditation.

Pariniti's journey is like a video game where she has embarked on a journey. As she unlocks various levels, she receives gifts from God.

We also get to know about chakras and mudras and their significance over a person's body.

This book is different from the others that I have read in this genre because it is not a guide to meditation. As the author says in the book, "There are as many forms of meditation as there are people who practise it."

It is totally up to you how you want to find yourself. Meditation is not a mathematical question to be solved. Instead, it is more of finding your own process to study that will allow you to solve all the questions at your own pace.

I loved reading about Pariniti's experience of Past Life Regression and Akashic Records. It helped Pariniti look into her past and future.

I really liked the cover of the book. It signifies that the mystery is inside you and nowhere else.

If you want to know what all you are capable of doing through meditation and are excited to embark on this journey, then this book is definitely recommended. Whether you have never meditated or have been meditating for a long time, this book will definitely give you insights into the possibilities you might never have thought of.

### ***Happy Reading!!***
