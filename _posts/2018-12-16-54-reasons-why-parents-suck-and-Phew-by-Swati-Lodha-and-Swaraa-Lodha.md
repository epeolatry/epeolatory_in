### **Blurb:**
The book is a tongue in cheek take on things parents should and should not do. It talks about various beliefs, behaviour and biases held by most parents that make them annoying and difficult. So, all you parents out thereâ€”be a good sport, pick up this book and see for yourself the heart of a teenager. 54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew! will leave you with one big reason to understand your child, all over again. 

### **My Review:**
"54 Reasons Why Parents Suck and Phew..." The book gets you all excited merely by its title. 

Although I had all my reasons listed in my mind about why parents suck, I wanted to know what this mother - daughter duo has to say about parents. 

I never knew that the problems I face with my parents are so universal. It was so realistic that at no point I could say that it never happened to me or this is so unrealistic. NEVER.

Initially I found the thoughts haphazardly written but I grew used to the style which was actually very interesting to read. The analogies were apt and again, relatable. 

I have always felt closest to my sister in my entire social circle. We argue and we fight but we share our deepest concerns, our worries, thoughts and ideas with each other. And reading this book was like just another of our discussions where we speak, we listen, we understand and never judge.

This book made me cry and it made me laugh. It made me hate my parents and it made me love them more. It was a rollercoaster ride in true terms tantalized by the idea of perfect parents.

Well! Nobody is perfect. Neither are we nor are our parents. Only if we both realise our weaknesses, we have a scope for improvement.

After reading the book you just have two options in front of you
Confront your parents and improve your relations
Pick the smallest of their issues, argue and worsen your relationship.

1st option is not an easy one. It will take time. But will definitely keep your family happier. 

### ***Happy Reading!!***
