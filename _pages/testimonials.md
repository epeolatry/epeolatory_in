"Falguni is a wonderful person. She is a great supporter. She does her work precisely. She helped me spot the errors when I couldn't see them because of continuously editing the same again and again. A writer can't find mistakes on his own, that's why they need editor so they can polish the work by eliminating errors. Falguni helped me. She told me to make corrections which were left unseen. She did her work honestly. And I am proud of it. I recommend her to my friends and even on the platform where she can get recognition for her honest work. 
I am glad we are connected ❣️"

"Falguni was one of the beta readers for my book and she was very professional at all times. She was great at finding details in the book that needed some more of my attention and always very helpful with questions I had. It was very easy to collaborate with Falguni because she always responded to emails and messengers in a timely maner, she also read the book quickly and had comments along the way. I would recommend using her if you are in need for a beta reader."

The aspects she pointed out and addressed were unique to her own experience and comprehension.I certainly feel I gained some perspective and help towards my final product by employing her services.I would recommend Falguni for anyone needing a Beta Reader and an excellent source of outside perspective and feedback."
