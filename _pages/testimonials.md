*"I recently had Falguni Jain beta read for my book, and found her to be very friendly, respectful and finished my book in a timely manner.Their assessment was fair, refreshing and detailed. The aspects she pointed out and addressed were unique to her own experience and comprehension.I certainly feel I gained some perspective and help towards my final product by employing her services.I would recommend Falguni for anyone needing a Beta Reader and an excellent source of outside perspective and feedback."*
