### About Me
Hi, I am Falguni. I am a compulsive reader, who loves to live in the fantasy world of fiction. I am a B.Com (Hons.) graduate from Delhi University and am currently pursuing PG Diploma in Book Publishing from Indira Gandhi National Open University. I left my full-time job as an auditor to be a freelance editor.

I started my Instagram account a few years ago. Initially, I just used it for sharing the quotes that I loved, but gradually started adding book reviews, too. The account helped me socialise with various bloggers, authors, and publishers. 

I have collaborated with authors and worked on editing, proofreading, story shaping, fact-checking, providing suggestions, and formatting the book to make it print-ready. I have worked on fiction, self-help books, memoirs, short stories, academic, and religious texts. I have worked with published authors and publishers to organise giveaways, create promotional materials, and provide book reviews.
