### About Me
Hi, I am Falguni. I am a compulsive reader, who loves to live in the fantasy world of fiction. I am a B.Com Hons. graduate from Delhi University. I left my full time job as an auditor to be a freelance editor. 

I started my Instagram account during my undergraduation. Initially I just used it for sharing the quotes that I loved, but gradually started adding book reviews too. The account helped me socialize with various bloggers, authors, and publishers. Within a few months, I found myself helping authors by promoting their books, organizing giveaways, proofreading, and editing their books. 

### My Services
I provide the following services:
- Book Reviews
- Beta Reading
- Proof Reading
- Editing
