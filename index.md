### About Me
I’m Falguni Jain, an editor and writing consultant who works on long-form fiction and non-fiction, focusing on clarity, structure, and voice. I’ve worked on over 130 books across fiction and non-fiction, supporting both debut and published authors at different stages of their writing journey.

I hold a B.Com (Hons.) degree from Delhi University and a PG Diploma in Book Publishing from Indira Gandhi National Open University, which has given me a strong grounding in both the creative and technical aspects of publishing. My work spans developmental editing, line editing, manuscript review, and writing consultancy, with a focus on reader experience rather than surface-level fixes.

I approach every project through careful reading, conversation, and collaboration. I don’t use AI tools in my editorial work; all feedback and edits are grounded in close engagement with the text and respect for the author’s intent. I’ve also served as a judge for the Page Turner Awards (2022 onwards) and NMIMS Debating Fests, experiences that have sharpened my understanding of what makes a story or an argument distinctive and effective.

My goal is not to rewrite your work, but to help you see it more clearly and move forward with confidence.

Let's embark on this creative journey together!
