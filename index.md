### About Me
Hi, I'm Falguni and I'm a freelance editor and compulsive reader. I am a B.Com (Hons.) graduate from Delhi University, and I'm currently pursuing PG Diploma in Book Publishing from Indira Gandhi National Open University.

I'm passionate about books and reading, and I'm deeply invested in helping authors bring their stories to life. I love living in the fantasy world of fiction, and I'm always looking for new and exciting stories to read.

I started my Instagram account in 2017 as a way to share bookish quotes that I love. Over time, I began adding book reviews as well, which helped me socialise with various bloggers, authors, and publishers. 

Now, I collaborate with authors to offer editing, proofreading, story shaping, fact-checking, providing suggestions, and formatting the book to make it print-ready. I'm experienced in working on fiction, self-help books, memoirs, short stories, and academic and religious texts.

I'm a firm believer in the power of storytelling and its ability to connect people and break down barriers. I'm deeply invested in creating a positive and inclusive environment that celebrates diverse voices. I'm always looking forward to connecting with authors and readers from all over the world.

I'm very excited to read your work and be a part of your publishing journey.
