Working with Falguni was an extremely delightful experience. She was always willing to listen to my concerns and address them. She was approachable and has really good knowledge.

It was a great experience working with Falguni Jain. She has good knowledge and sharp eyes to find errors. Her valuable guidance helped me to rewrite boring paragraphs and scenes. She was always ready to listen to my concerns and was ready to do multiple edits, nevertheless, she delivered it on time. She has an excellent command of the English language. I want to thank her for her praiseworthy efforts to improve my book. She has expertise in copy editing, proofreading, and developmental editing. I am looking forward to working with her further in the future.

As a western author it has always been my intention to have my novel, “HOUSE BOY”, vetted by a qualified advisor/content editor from inside the South Asian culture in which the story takes place. I believe that writers of the world should be able to explore anything that moves them, which means anything under the sun. But writing about cultures other than our own requires a personal admission of our “outsiderness” and a respect for historical and sociological realities we can only attempt to understand.

So I’m all the more pleased with the insightful and attentive work done by Falguni Jain in helping me avoid any cultural or religious missteps in my quest to share the harrowing modern slavery story of young Vijay Pallan. She has helped immeasurably to authenticate my book and to focus its outrage over one of the most pressing issues of our time - human trafficking.

Falguni has been a delight to work with. She is highly knowledgeable about the intricacies of editing and she is extremely dedicated to her job. She is a fast learner and she was able to pick up abstract philosophical concepts very quickly. Her attention to detail is a key trait that helped in producing this book to desired quality standards. Most significantly, she respects the author’s voice and focuses on maintaining the purity of the vision.

My journey of editing my book with Falguni was amazing. She has good vision and prepares a step-by-step plan with predetermined milestones while working. She took time with my work and didn't rush things and was still able to deliver the work on time. I hope we will have more opportunities to work together in near future.

I have found Falguni very professional and committed to her work. I was impressed with her speed and good grasp to complex subject as “Kala Ghoda: The Game of Power”. She not only understood the characters and plot quickly but suggested few improvements and changes to improve the narration.
I will surely recommend her to any of my fellow authors and would look forward to collaborating with her in future too.

"'The beautiful Sky' as a novel means a lot to me, just like every other author. Each one thinks that it is a special and unique one, but while going through the continuous and long routine you skip out the minor details or the mistakes, for that its very important for a professional reviewer. I came across such a very talented person, Falguni Jain (@Bookworm_falguni). She is perfect in her work, and her every fifty-page review through the mail was very awesome. The best part the reviews are very honest, whether the author likes it or not, and that's what real professionalism is. I will recommend the same to the other authors/screenwriters in my friend's circle.
Thanks for such a wonderful collaboration.
Excited soon to work on the next project."

"Falguni is a wonderful person. She is a great supporter. She does her work precisely. She helped me spot the errors when I couldn't see them because of continuously editing the same again and again. A writer can't find mistakes on his own, that's why they need editor so they can polish the work by eliminating errors. Falguni helped me. She told me to make corrections which were left unseen. She did her work honestly. And I am proud of it. I recommend her to my friends and even on the platform where she can get recognition for her honest work. 
I am glad we are connected ❣️"

"Falguni was one of the beta readers for my book and she was very professional at all times. She was great at finding details in the book that needed some more of my attention and always very helpful with questions I had. It was very easy to collaborate with Falguni because she always responded to emails and messages in a timely maner, she also read the book quickly and had comments along the way. I would recommend using her if you are in need for a beta reader."

"I recently had Falguni Jain beta read for my book, and found her to be very friendly, respectful and finished my book in a timely manner. Her assessment was fair, refreshing and detailed. The aspects she pointed out and addressed were unique to her own experience and comprehension. I certainly feel I gained some perspective and help towards my final product by employing her services. I would recommend Falguni for anyone needing a Beta Reader and an excellent source of outside perspective and feedback."
